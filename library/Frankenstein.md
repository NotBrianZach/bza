<p>PREFACE</p>
<p>THE event on which this ﬁction is founded has been</p>
<p>supposed, by Dr. Darwin, and some of the physio-</p>
<p>logical writers of Germany, as not of impossible oc-</p>
<p>currence. I shall not be supposed as according the</p>
<p>remotest degree of serious faith to such an imagi-</p>
<p>nation; yet, in assuming it as the basis of a work of</p>
<p>fancy, I have not considered myself as merely weav-</p>
<p>ing a series of supernatural terrors. The event on</p>
<p>which the interest of the story depends is exempt</p>
<p>from the disadvantages of a mere tale of spectres or</p>
<p>enchantment. It was recommended by the novelty</p>
<p>of the situations which it developes; and, however</p>
<p>vi</p>
<p>impossible as a physical fact, affords a point of view</p>
<p>to the imagination for the delineating of human pas-</p>
<p>sions more comprehensive and commanding than</p>
<p>any which the ordinary relations of existing events</p>
<p>can yield.</p>
<p>I have thus endeavoured to preserve the truth</p>
<p>of the elementary principles of human nature, while</p>
<p>I have not scrupled to innovate upon their com-</p>
<p>binations. The Iliad, the tragic poetry of Greece,</p>
<p>— Shakespeare, in the Tempest and Midsummer</p>
<p>Night’s Dream, — and most especially Milton, in</p>
<p>Paradise Lost, conform to this rule; and the most</p>
<p>humble novelist, who seeks to confer or receive</p>
<p>amusement from his labours, may, without pre-</p>
<p>sumption, apply to prose ﬁction a licence, or rather</p>
<p>a rule, from the adoption of which so many exquisite</p>
<p>combinations of human feeling have resulted in the</p>
<p>highest specimens of poetry.</p>
<p>The circumstance on which my story rests was</p>
<p>suggested in casual conversation. It was com-</p>
<p>menced, partly as a source of amusement, and</p>
<p>partly as an expedient for exercising any untried re-</p>
<p>sources of mind. Other motives were mingled with</p>
<p>these, as the work proceeded. I am by no means</p>
<p>indifferent to the manner in which whatever moral</p>
<p>tendencies exist in the sentiments or characters it</p>
<p>contains shall affect the reader; yet my chief con-</p>
<p>cern in this respect has been limited to the avoiding</p>
<p>of the enervating effects of the novels of the present</p>
<p>day, and to the exhibition of the amiableness of do-</p>
<p>mestic affection, and the excellence of universal</p>
<p>virtue. The opinions which naturally spring from</p>
<p>the character and situation of the hero are by no</p>
<p>means to be conceived as existing always in my</p>
<p>own conviction; nor is any inference justly to be</p>
<p>drawn from the following pages as prejudicing any</p>
<p>philosophical doctrine of whatever kind.</p>
<p>It is a subject also of additional interest to the</p>
<p>author, that this story was begun in the majestic</p>
<p>region where the scene is principally laid, and in so-</p>
<p>ciety which cannot cease to be regretted. I passed</p>
<p>the summer of 1816 in the environs of Geneva. The</p>
<p>season was cold and rainy, and in the evenings</p>
<p>we crowded around a blazing wood ﬁre, and oc-</p>
<p>casionally amused ourselves with some German</p>
<p>stories of ghosts, which happened to fall into our</p>
<p>hands. These tales excited in us a playful desire of</p>
<p>imitation. Two other friends (a tale from the pen of</p>
<p>one of whom would be far more acceptable to the</p>
<p>public than any thing I can ever hope to produce)</p>
<p>and myself agreed to write each a story, founded</p>
<p>on some supernatural occurrence.</p>
<p>The weather, however, suddenly became ser-</p>
<p>ene; and my two friends left me on a journey among</p>
<p>the Alps, and lost, in the magniﬁcent scenes which</p>
<p>they present, all memory of their ghostly visions.</p>
<p>The following tale is the only one which has been</p>
<p>completed.</p>
<p>Volume I</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Letter I</p>
<p>To Mrs. SAVILLE, England.</p>
<p>St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17—.</p>
<p>YOU will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accom-</p>
<p>panied the commencement of an enterprise which</p>
<p>you have regarded with such evil forebodings. I</p>
<p>arrived here yesterday; and my ﬁrst task is to as-</p>
<p>sure my dear sister of my welfare, and increasing</p>
<p>conﬁdence in the success of my undertaking.</p>
<p>I am already far north of London; and as I walk</p>
<p>in the streets of Petersburgh, I feel a cold north-</p>
<p>ern breeze play upon my cheeks, which braces my</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>nerves, and ﬁlls me with delight. Do you understand</p>
<p>this feeling? This breeze, which has travelled from</p>
<p>the regions towards which I am advancing, gives</p>
<p>me a foretaste of those icy climes. Inspirited by</p>
<p>this wind of promise, my day dreams become more</p>
<p>fervent and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that</p>
<p>the pole is the seat of frost and desolation; it ever</p>
<p>presents itself to my imagination as the region of</p>
<p>beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for</p>
<p>ever visible; its broad disk just skirting the horizon,</p>
<p>and diffusing a perpetual splendour. There — for</p>
<p>with your leave, my sister, I will put some trust in</p>
<p>preceding navigators — there snow and frost are</p>
<p>banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we may</p>
<p>be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in</p>
<p>beauty every region hitherto discovered on the hab-</p>
<p>itable globe. Its productions and features may be</p>
<p>without example, as the phænomena of the heav-</p>
<p>enly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered</p>
<p>solitudes. What may not be expected in a country</p>
<p>of eternal light? I may there discover the wondrous</p>
<p>power which attracts the needle; and may regulate</p>
<p>a thousand celestial observations, that require only</p>
<p>this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities</p>
<p>consistent for ever. I shall satiate my ardent cu-</p>
<p>riosity with the sight of a part of the world never</p>
<p>before visited, and may tread a land never before</p>
<p>imprinted by the foot of man. These are my entice-</p>
<p>ments, and they are sufﬁcient to conquer all fear of</p>
<p>danger or death, and to induce me to commence</p>
<p>this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when</p>
<p>he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates,</p>
<p>on an expedition of discovery up his native river.</p>
<p>But, supposing all these conjectures to be false,</p>
<p>you cannot contest the inestimable beneﬁt which I</p>
<p>shall confer on all mankind to the last generation, by</p>
<p>discovering a passage near the pole to those coun-</p>
<p>tries, to reach which at present so many months are</p>
<p>requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the mag-</p>
<p>net, which, if at all possible, can only be effected by</p>
<p>an undertaking such as mine.</p>
<p>These reﬂections have dispelled the agitation</p>
<p>with which I began my letter, and I feel my heart</p>
<p>glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to</p>
<p>heaven; for nothing contributes so much to tran-</p>
<p>quillize the mind as a steady purpose, — a point on</p>
<p>which the soul may ﬁx its intellectual eye. This</p>
<p>expedition has been the favourite dream of my</p>
<p>early years. I have read with ardour the accounts</p>
<p>of the various voyages which have been made in</p>
<p>the prospect of arriving at the North Paciﬁc Ocean</p>
<p>through the seas which surround the pole. You may</p>
<p>remember, that a history of all the voyages made</p>
<p>for purposes of discovery composed the whole of</p>
<p>our good uncle Thomas’s library. My education was</p>
<p>neglected, yet I was passionately fond of reading.</p>
<p>These volumes were my study day and night, and</p>
<p>my familiarity with them increased that regret which</p>
<p>I had felt, as a child, on learning that my father’s</p>
<p>dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me</p>
<p>to embark in a sea-faring life.</p>
<p>These visions faded when I perused, for the</p>
<p>ﬁrst time, those poets whose effusions entranced</p>
<p>my soul, and lifted it to heaven. I also became a</p>
<p>poet, and for one year lived in a Paradise of my</p>
<p>own creation; I imagined that I also might obtain</p>
<p>a niche in the temple where the names of Homer</p>
<p>and Shakespeare are consecrated. You are well</p>
<p>acquainted with my failure, and how heavily I bore</p>
<p>the disappointment. But just at that time I inherited</p>
<p>the fortune of my cousin, and my thoughts were</p>
<p>turned into the channel of their earlier bent.</p>
<p>Six years have passed since I resolved on my</p>
<p>present undertaking. I can, even now, remember</p>
<p>the hour from which I dedicated myself to this great</p>
<p>enterprise. I commenced by inuring my body to</p>
<p>hardship. I accompanied the whale-ﬁshers on sev-</p>
<p>eral expeditions to the North Sea; I voluntarily en-</p>
<p>dured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I of-</p>
<p>ten worked harder than the common sailors dur-</p>
<p>ing the day, and devoted my nights to the study</p>
<p>of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those</p>
<p>branches of physical science from which a naval</p>
<p>adventurer might derive the greatest practical ad-</p>
<p>vantage. Twice I actually hired myself as an under-</p>
<p>mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself</p>
<p>to admiration. I must own I felt a little proud, when</p>
<p>my captain offered me the second dignity in the</p>
<p>vessel, and entreated me to remain with the great-</p>
<p>est earnestness; so valuable did he consider my</p>
<p>services.</p>
<p>And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to ac-</p>
<p>complish some great purpose. My life might have</p>
<p>been passed in ease and luxury; but I preferred</p>
<p>glory to every enticement that wealth placed in my</p>
<p>path. Oh, that some encouraging voice would an-</p>
<p>swer in the afﬁrmative! My courage and my resolu-</p>
<p>tion is ﬁrm; but my hopes ﬂuctuate, and my spirits</p>
<p>are often depressed. I am about to proceed on a</p>
<p>long and difﬁcult voyage; the emergencies of which</p>
<p>will demand all my fortitude: I am required not only</p>
<p>to raise the spirits of others, but sometimes to sus-</p>
<p>tain my own, when their’s are failing.</p>
<p>This is the most favourable period for travelling</p>
<p>in Russia. They ﬂy quickly over the snow in their</p>
<p>sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in my opinion,</p>
<p>far more agreeable than that of an English stage-</p>
<p>coach. The cold is not excessive, if you are wrapt in</p>
<p>furs, a dress which I have already adopted; for there</p>
<p>is a great difference between walking the deck and</p>
<p>remaining seated motionless for hours, when no</p>
<p>exercise prevents the blood from actually freezing in</p>
<p>your veins. I have no ambition to lose my life on the</p>
<p>post-road between St. Petersburgh and Archangel.</p>
<p>I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or</p>
<p>three weeks; and my intention is to hire a ship there,</p>
<p>which can easily be done by paying the insurance</p>
<p>for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I</p>
<p>think necessary among those who are accustomed</p>
<p>to the whale-ﬁshing. I do not intend to sail until</p>
<p>the month of June: and when shall I return? Ah,</p>
<p>dear sister, how can I answer this question? If I</p>
<p>succeed, many, many months, perhaps years, will</p>
<p>pass before you and I may meet. If I fail, you will</p>
<p>see me again soon, or never.</p>
<p>Farewell, my dear, excellent, Margaret. Heaven</p>
<p>shower down blessings on you, and save me, that I</p>
<p>may again and again testify my gratitude for all your</p>
<p>love and kindness.</p>
<p>Your affectionate brother,</p>
<p>R. WALTON.</p>
<p>Letter II</p>
<p>To Mrs. SAVILLE, England.</p>
<p>Archangel, 28th March, 17—.</p>
<p>HOW slowly the time passes here, encompassed</p>
<p>as I am by frost and snow; yet a second step is</p>
<p>taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a vessel,</p>
<p>and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those</p>
<p>whom I have already engaged appear to be men on</p>
<p>whom I can depend, and are certainly possessed</p>
<p>of dauntless courage.</p>
<p>But I have one want which I have never yet</p>
<p>been able to satisfy; and the absence of the object</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>of which I now feel as a most severe evil. I have no</p>
<p>friend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthu-</p>
<p>siasm of success, there will be none to participate</p>
<p>my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no one</p>
<p>will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall</p>
<p>commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but that is a</p>
<p>poor medium for the communication of feeling. I de-</p>
<p>sire the company of a man who could sympathize</p>
<p>with me; whose eyes would reply to mine. You may</p>
<p>deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I bitterly feel</p>
<p>the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle</p>
<p>yet courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well</p>
<p>as of a capacious mind, whose tastes are like my</p>
<p>own, to approve or amend my plans. How would</p>
<p>such a friend repair the faults of your poor brother!</p>
<p>I am too ardent in execution, and too impatient of</p>
<p>difﬁculties. But it is a still greater evil to me that I</p>
<p>am self-educated: for the ﬁrst fourteen years of my</p>
<p>life I ran wild on a common, and read nothing but</p>
<p>our uncle Thomas’s books of voyages. At that age I</p>
<p>became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our</p>
<p>own country; but it was only when it had ceased to</p>

<p>be in my power to derive its most important beneﬁts</p>
<p>from such a conviction, that I perceived the neces-</p>
<p>sity of becoming acquainted with more languages</p>
<p>than that of my native country. Now I am twenty-</p>
<p>eight, and am in reality more illiterate than many</p>
<p>school-boys of ﬁfteen. It is true that I have thought</p>
<p>more, and that my day dreams are more extended</p>
<p>and magniﬁcent; but they want (as the painters call</p>
<p>it) keeping; and I greatly need a friend who would</p>
<p>have sense enough not to despise me as roman-</p>
<p>tic, and affection enough for me to endeavour to</p>
<p>regulate my mind.</p>
<p>Well, these are useless complaints; I shall cer-</p>
<p>tainly ﬁnd no friend on the wide ocean, nor even</p>
<p>here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen.</p>
<p>Yet some feelings, unallied to the dross of human</p>
<p>nature, beat even in these rugged bosoms. My lieu-</p>
<p>tenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage</p>
<p>and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory. He</p>
<p>is an Englishman, and in the midst of national and</p>
<p>professional prejudices, unsoftened by cultivation,</p>
<p>retains some of the noblest endowments of human-</p>
<p>ity. I ﬁrst became acquainted with him on board</p>
<p>a whale vessel: ﬁnding that he was unemployed</p>
<p>in this city, I easily engaged him to assist in my</p>
<p>enterprise.</p>
<p>The master is a person of an excellent dispo-</p>
<p>sition, and is remarkable in the ship for his gen-</p>
<p>tleness, and the mildness of his discipline. He is,</p>
<p>indeed, of so amiable a nature, that he will not hunt</p>
<p>(a favourite, and almost the only amusement here),</p>
<p>because he cannot endure to spill blood. He is,</p>
<p>moreover, heroically generous. Some years ago he</p>
<p>loved a young Russian lady, of moderate fortune;</p>
<p>and having amassed a considerable sum in prize-</p>
<p>money, the father of the girl consented to the match.</p>
<p>He saw his mistress once before the destined cere-</p>
<p>mony; but she was bathed in tears, and, throwing</p>
<p>herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her, con-</p>
<p>fessing at the same time that she loved another, but</p>
<p>that he was poor, and that her father would never</p>
<p>consent to the union. My generous friend reassured</p>
<p>the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of</p>
<p>her lover instantly abandoned his pursuit. He had</p>
<p>already bought a farm with his money, on which he</p>
<p>had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but</p>
<p>he bestowed the whole on his rival, together with</p>
<p>the remains of his prize-money to purchase stock,</p>
<p>and then himself solicited the young woman’s father</p>
<p>to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the</p>
<p>old man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound</p>
<p>in honour to my friend; who, when he found the</p>
<p>father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned</p>
<p>until he heard that his former mistress was married</p>
<p>according to her inclinations. “What a noble fellow!”</p>
<p>you will exclaim. He is so; but then he has passed</p>
<p>all his life on board a vessel, and has scarcely an</p>
<p>idea beyond the rope and the shroud.</p>
<p>But do not suppose that, because I complain a</p>
<p>little, or because I can conceive a consolation for</p>
<p>my toils which I may never know, that I am wavering</p>
<p>in my resolutions. Those are as ﬁxed as fate; and</p>
<p>my voyage is only now delayed until the weather</p>
<p>shall permit my embarkation. The winter has been</p>
<p>dreadfully severe; but the spring promises well, and</p>
<p>it is considered as a remarkably early season; so</p>
<p>that, perhaps, I may sail sooner than I expected. I</p>
<p>shall do nothing rashly; you know me sufﬁciently</p>
<p>to conﬁde in my prudence and considerateness</p>
<p>whenever the safety of others is committed to my</p>
<p>care.</p>
<p>I cannot describe to you my sensations on the</p>
<p>near prospect of my undertaking. It is impossible to</p>
<p>communicate to you a conception of the trembling</p>
<p>sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with</p>
<p>which I am preparing to depart. I am going to unex-</p>
<p>plored regions, to “the land of mist and snow;” but I</p>
<p>shall kill no albatross, therefore do not be alarmed</p>
<p>for my safety.</p>
<p>Shall I meet you again, after having traversed</p>
<p>immense seas, and returned by the most southern</p>
<p>cape of Africa or America? I dare not expect such</p>
<p>success, yet I cannot bear to look on the reverse</p>
<p>of the picture. Continue to write to me by every</p>
<p>opportunity: I may receive your letters (though the</p>
<p>chance is very doubtful) on some occasions when</p>
<p>I need them most to support my spirits. I love you</p>
<p>very tenderly. Remember me with affection, should</p>
<p>you never hear from me again.</p>
<p>Your affectionate brother,</p>
<p>ROBERT WALTON.</p>

<p>Letter III</p>
<p>To Mrs. SAVILLE, England.</p>
<p>July 7th, 17—.</p>
<p>MY DEAR SISTER,</p>
<p>I WRITE a few lines in haste, to say that I am safe,</p>
<p>and well advanced on my voyage. This letter will</p>
<p>reach England by a merchant-man now on its home-</p>
<p>ward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I,</p>
<p>who may not see my native land, perhaps, for many</p>
<p>years. I am, however, in good spirits: my men are</p>
<p>bold, and apparently ﬁrm of purpose; nor do the</p>

<p>ﬂoating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indi-</p>
<p>cating the dangers of the region towards which we</p>
<p>are advancing, appear to dismay them. We have</p>
<p>already reached a very high latitude; but it is the</p>
<p>height of summer, and although not so warm as in</p>
<p>England, the southern gales, which blow us speed-</p>
<p>ily towards those shores which I so ardently desire</p>
<p>to attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth</p>
<p>which I had not expected.</p>
<p>No incidents have hitherto befallen us, that</p>
<p>would make a ﬁgure in a letter. One or two stiff</p>
<p>gales, and the breaking of a mast, are accidents</p>
<p>which experienced navigators scarcely remember</p>
<p>to record; and I shall be well content, if nothing</p>
<p>worse happen to us during our voyage.</p>
<p>Adieu, my dear Margaret. Be assured, that for</p>
<p>my own sake, as well as your’s, I will not rashly</p>
<p>encounter danger. I will be cool, persevering, and</p>
<p>prudent.</p>
<p>Remember me to all my English friends.</p>

<p>very thick fog. We accordingly lay to, hoping that</p>
<p>some change would take place in the atmosphere</p>
<p>and weather.</p>
<p>About two o’clock the mist cleared away, and we</p>
<p>beheld, stretched out in every direction, vast and</p>
<p>irregular plains of ice, which seemed to have no</p>
<p>end. Some of my comrades groaned, and my own</p>
<p>mind began to grow watchful with anxious thoughts,</p>
<p>when a strange sight suddenly attracted our at-</p>
<p>tention, and diverted our solicitude from our own</p>
<p>situation. We perceived a low carriage, ﬁxed on a</p>
<p>sledge and drawn by dogs, pass on towards the</p>
<p>north, at the distance of half a mile: a being which</p>
<p>had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigan-</p>
<p>tic stature, sat in the sledge, and guided the dogs.</p>
<p>We watched the rapid progress of the traveller with</p>
<p>our telescopes, until he was lost among the distant</p>
<p>inequalities of the ice.</p>
<p>This appearance excited our unqualiﬁed won-</p>
<p>der. We were, as we believed, many hundred miles</p>
<p>from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote</p>
<p>that it was not, in reality, so distant as we had sup-</p>

<p>to follow his track, which we had observed with the</p>
<p>greatest attention.</p>
<p>About two hours after this occurrence, we heard</p>
<p>the ground sea; and before night the ice broke, and</p>
<p>freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the morn-</p>

<p>hours.</p>
<p>In the morning, however, as soon as it was light,</p>
<p>I went upon deck, and found all the sailors busy on</p>
<p>one side of the vessel, apparently talking to some</p>
<p>one in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we</p>
<p>had seen before, which had drifted towards us in</p>
<p>the night, on a large fragment of ice. Only one dog</p>
<p>remained alive; but there was a human being within</p>
<p>it, whom the sailors were persuading to enter the</p>
<p>vessel. He was not, as the other traveller seemed</p>
<p>to be, a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered</p>

<p>On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me</p>
<p>in English, although with a foreign accent. “Before I</p>
<p>come on board your vessel,” said he, “will you have</p>
<p>the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?”</p>
<p>You may conceive my astonishment on hearing</p>
<p>such a question addressed to me from a man on</p>
<p>the brink of destruction, and to whom I should have</p>
<p>supposed that my vessel would have been a re-</p>
<p>source which he would not have exchanged for the</p>
<p>most precious wealth the earth can afford. I replied,</p>
<p>however, that we were on a voyage of discovery</p>
<p>towards the northern pole.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this he appeared satisﬁed, and</p>
<p>consented to come on board. Good God! Margaret,</p>
<p>if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for</p>
<p>his safety, your surprise would have been bound-</p>
<p>less. His limbs were nearly frozen, and his body</p>
<p>dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering. I</p>
<p>never saw a man in so wretched a condition. We at-</p>

<p>he had quitted the fresh air, he fainted. We accord-</p>

<p>blankets, and placed him near the chimney of the</p>
<p>kitchen-stove. By slow degrees he recovered, and</p>
<p>ate a little soup, which restored him wonderfully.</p>
<p>Two days passed in this manner before he was</p>
<p>able to speak; and I often feared that his sufferings</p>
<p>had deprived him of understanding. When he had</p>
<p>in some measure recovered, I removed him to my</p>
<p>own cabin, and attended on him as much as my</p>
<p>duty would permit. I never saw a more interesting</p>
<p>creature: his eyes have generally an expression</p>
<p>of wildness, and even madness; but there are mo-</p>
<p>ments when, if any one performs an act of kindness</p>
<p>towards him, or does him any the most triﬂing ser-</p>
<p>vice, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were,</p>
<p>with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that</p>
<p>I never saw equalled. But he is generally melan-</p>
<p>choly and despairing; and sometimes he gnashes</p>
<p>his teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that</p>
<p>oppresses him.</p>
<p>When my guest was a little recovered, I had</p>
<p>great trouble to keep off the men, who wished to</p>
<p>ask him a thousand questions; but I would not allow</p>
<p>him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a</p>
<p>state of body and mind whose restoration evidently</p>
<p>depended upon entire repose. Once, however, the</p>
<p>lieutenant asked, Why he had come so far upon the</p>
<p>ice in so strange a vehicle?</p>
<p>His countenance instantly assumed an aspect</p>
<p>of the deepest gloom; and he replied, “To seek one</p>
<p>who ﬂed from me.”</p>
<p>“And did the man whom you pursued travel in</p>
<p>the same fashion?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Then I fancy we have seen him; for, the day be-</p>
<p>fore we picked you up, we saw some dogs drawing</p>
<p>a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.”</p>
<p>This aroused the stranger’s attention; and he</p>
<p>asked a multitude of questions concerning the route</p>
<p>which the dæmon, as he called him, had pursued.</p>
<p>Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, “I</p>
<p>have, doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as</p>
<p>that of these good people; but you are too consid-</p>
<p>erate to make inquiries.”</p>
<p>“Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent</p>
<p>and inhuman in me to trouble you with any inquisi-</p>
<p>tiveness of mine.”</p>
<p>“And yet you rescued me from a strange and</p>
<p>perilous situation; you have benevolently restored</p>
<p>me to life.”</p>
<p>Soon after this he inquired, if I thought that</p>
<p>the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the other</p>
<p>sledge? I replied, that I could not answer with any</p>
<p>degree of certainty; for the ice had not broken until</p>
<p>near midnight, and the traveller might have arrived</p>
<p>at a place of safety before that time; but of this I</p>
<p>could not judge.</p>
<p>From this time the stranger seemed very eager</p>
<p>to be upon deck, to watch for the sledge which</p>
<p>had before appeared; but I have persuaded him</p>
<p>to remain in the cabin, for he is far too weak to</p>
<p>sustain the rawness of the atmosphere. But I have</p>
<p>promised that some one should watch for him, and</p>
<p>give him instant notice if any new object should</p>
<p>appear in sight.</p>
<p>Such is my journal of what relates to this</p>
<p>strange occurrence up to the present day. The</p>
<p>stranger has gradually improved in health, but is</p>
<p>very silent, and appears uneasy when any one</p>
<p>except myself enters his cabin. Yet his manners are</p>
<p>so conciliating and gentle, that the sailors are all</p>
<p>interested in him, although they have had very little</p>
<p>communication with him. For my own part, I begin</p>
<p>to love him as a brother; and his constant and deep</p>
<p>grief ﬁlls me with sympathy and compassion. He</p>
<p>must have been a noble creature in his better days,</p>
<p>being even now in wreck so attractive and amiable.</p>
<p>I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret,</p>
<p>that I should ﬁnd no friend on the wide ocean; yet I</p>
<p>have found a man who, before his spirit had been</p>
<p>broken by misery, I should have been happy to have</p>
<p>possessed as the brother of my heart.</p>
<p>I shall continue my journal concerning the</p>
<p>stranger at intervals, should I have any fresh inci-</p>
<p>dents to record.</p>
<p>August 13th, 17—.</p>
<p>My affection for my guest increases every day.</p>
<p>He excites at once my admiration and my pity to</p>
<p>an astonishing degree. How can I see so noble</p>
<p>a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the</p>
<p>most poignant grief? He is so gentle, yet so wise;</p>
<p>his mind is so cultivated; and when he speaks,</p>
<p>although his words are culled with the choicest</p>
<p>art, yet they ﬂow with rapidity and unparalleled elo-</p>
<p>quence.</p>
<p>He is now much recovered from his illness, and</p>
<p>is continually on the deck, apparently watching for</p>
<p>the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although</p>
<p>unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own</p>
<p>misery, but that he interests himself deeply in the</p>
<p>employments of others. He has asked me many</p>
<p>questions concerning my design; and I have re-</p>
<p>lated my little history frankly to him. He appeared</p>
<p>pleased with the conﬁdence, and suggested several</p>
<p>alterations in my plan, which I shall ﬁnd exceedingly</p>
<p>useful. There is no pedantry in his manner; but</p>
<p>all he does appears to spring solely from the in-</p>
<p>terest he instinctively takes in the welfare of those</p>
<p>who surround him. He is often overcome by gloom,</p>
<p>and then he sits by himself, and tries to overcome</p>
<p>all that is sullen or unsocial in his humour. These</p>
<p>paroxysms pass from him like a cloud from before</p>
<p>the sun, though his dejection never leaves him. I</p>
<p>have endeavoured to win his conﬁdence; and I trust</p>
<p>that I have succeeded. One day I mentioned to him</p>
<p>the desire I had always felt of ﬁnding a friend who</p>
<p>might sympathize with me, and direct me by his</p>
<p>counsel. I said, I did not belong to that class of men</p>
<p>who are offended by advice. “I am self-educated,</p>
<p>and perhaps I hardly rely sufﬁciently upon my own</p>
<p>powers. I wish therefore that my companion should</p>
<p>be wiser and more experienced than myself, to</p>
<p>conﬁrm and support me; nor have I believed it im-</p>
<p>possible to ﬁnd a true friend.”</p>
<p>“I agree with you,” replied the stranger, “in be-</p>
<p>lieving that friendship is not only a desirable, but</p>
<p>a possible acquisition. I once had a friend, the</p>
<p>most noble of human creatures, and am entitled,</p>
<p>therefore, to judge respecting friendship. You have</p>
<p>hope, and the world before you, and have no cause</p>
<p>for despair. But I —— I have lost every thing, and</p>
<p>cannot begin life anew.”</p>
<p>As he said this, his countenance became ex-</p>
<p>pressive of a calm settled grief, that touched me to</p>
<p>the heart. But he was silent, and presently retired</p>
<p>to his cabin.</p>
<p>Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel</p>
<p>more deeply than he does the beauties of nature.</p>
<p>The starry sky, the sea, and every sight afforded</p>
<p>by these wonderful regions, seems still to have the</p>
<p>power of elevating his soul from earth. Such a man</p>
<p>has a double existence: he may suffer misery, and</p>
<p>be overwhelmed by disappointments; yet when he</p>
<p>has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial</p>
<p>spirit, that has a halo around him, within whose</p>
<p>circle no grief or folly ventures.</p>
<p>Will you laugh at the enthusiasm I express con-</p>
<p>cerning this divine wanderer? If you do, you must</p>
<p>have certainly lost that simplicity which was once</p>
<p>your characteristic charm. Yet, if you will, smile at</p>
<p>the warmth of my expressions, while I ﬁnd every</p>
<p>day new causes for repeating them.</p>
<p>August 19th, 17—.</p>
<p>Yesterday the stranger said to me, “You may</p>
<p>easily perceive, Captain Walton, that I have suf-</p>
<p>fered great and unparalleled misfortunes. I had</p>
<p>determined, once, that the memory of these evils</p>
<p>should die with me; but you have won me to alter</p>
<p>my determination. You seek for knowledge and wis-</p>
<p>dom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the</p>
<p>gratiﬁcation of your wishes may not be a serpent to</p>
<p>sting you, as mine has been. I do not know that the</p>
<p>relation of my misfortunes will be useful to you, yet,</p>
<p>if you are inclined, listen to my tale. I believe that</p>
<p>the strange incidents connected with it will afford</p>
<p>a view of nature, which may enlarge your faculties</p>
<p>and understanding. You will hear of powers and</p>
<p>occurrences, such as you have been accustomed</p>
<p>to believe impossible: but I do not doubt that my</p>
<p>tale conveys in its series internal evidence of the</p>
<p>truth of the events of which it is composed.”</p>
<p>You may easily conceive that I was much grati-</p>
<p>ﬁed by the offered communication; yet I could not</p>
<p>endure that he should renew his grief by a recital</p>
<p>of his misfortunes. I felt the greatest eagerness</p>
<p>to hear the promised narrative, partly from curios-</p>
<p>ity, and partly from a strong desire to ameliorate</p>
<p>his fate, if it were in my power. I expressed these</p>
<p>feelings in my answer.</p>
<p>“I thank you,” he replied, “for your sympathy, but</p>
<p>it is useless; my fate is nearly fulﬁlled. I wait but for</p>
<p>one event, and then I shall repose in peace. I under-</p>
<p>stand your feeling,” continued he, perceiving that I</p>
<p>wished to interrupt him; “but you are mistaken, my</p>
<p>friend, if thus you will allow me to name you; noth-</p>
<p>ing can alter my destiny: listen to my history, and</p>
<p>you will perceive how irrevocably it is determined.”</p>
<p>He then told me, that he would commence his</p>
<p>narrative the next day when I should be at leisure.</p>
<p>This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. I</p>
<p>have resolved every night, when I am not engaged,</p>
<p>to record, as nearly as possible in his own words,</p>
<p>what he has related during the day. If I should be</p>
<p>engaged, I will at least make notes. This manuscript</p>
<p>will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure: but</p>
<p>to me, who know him, and who hear it from his own</p>
<p>lips, with what interest and sympathy shall I read it</p>
<p>in some future day!</p>
<p>Chapter I</p>
<p>I AM by birth a Genevese; and my family is one of</p>
<p>the most distinguished of that republic. My ances-</p>
<p>tors had been for many years counsellors and syn-</p>
<p>dics; and my father had ﬁlled several public situa-</p>
<p>tions with honour and reputation. He was respected</p>
<p>by all who knew him for his integrity and indefati-</p>
<p>gable attention to public business. He passed his</p>
<p>younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs</p>
<p>of his country; and it was not until the decline of</p>
<p>life that he thought of marrying, and bestowing on</p>
<p>the state sons who might carry his virtues and his</p>
<p>name down to posterity.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate</p>
<p>his character, I cannot refrain from relating them.</p>
<p>One of his most intimate friends was a merchant,</p>
<p>who, from a ﬂourishing state, fell, through numerous</p>
<p>mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name</p>
<p>was Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending dis-</p>
<p>position, and could not bear to live in poverty and</p>
<p>oblivion in the same country where he had formerly</p>
<p>been distinguished for his rank and magniﬁcence.</p>
<p>Having paid his debts, therefore, in the most hon-</p>
<p>ourable manner, he retreated with his daughter to</p>
<p>the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and</p>
<p>in wretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with</p>
<p>the truest friendship, and was deeply grieved by</p>
<p>his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances. He</p>
<p>grieved also for the loss of his society, and resolved</p>
<p>to seek him out and endeavour to persuade him to</p>
<p>begin the world again through his credit and assis-</p>
<p>tance.</p>
<p>Beaufort had taken effectual measures to con-</p>
<p>ceal himself; and it was ten months before my father</p>
<p>discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery,</p>
<p>he hastened to the house, which was situated in a</p>
<p>mean street, near the Reuss. But when he entered,</p>
<p>misery and despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort</p>
<p>had saved but a very small sum of money from the</p>
<p>wreck of his fortunes; but it was sufﬁcient to provide</p>
<p>him with sustenance for some months, and in the</p>
<p>mean time he hoped to procure some respectable</p>
<p>employment in a merchant’s house. The interval</p>
<p>was consequently spent in inaction; his grief only</p>
<p>became more deep and rankling, when he had</p>
<p>leisure for reﬂection; and at length it took so fast</p>
<p>hold of his mind, that at the end of three months he</p>
<p>lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.</p>
<p>His daughter attended him with the greatest</p>
<p>tenderness; but she saw with despair that their little</p>
<p>fund was rapidly decreasing, and that there was no</p>
<p>other prospect of support. But Caroline Beaufort</p>
<p>possessed a mind of an uncommon mould; and</p>
<p>her courage rose to support her in her adversity.</p>
<p>She procured plain work; she plaited straw; and by</p>
<p>various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely</p>
<p>sufﬁcient to support life.</p>
<p>Several months passed in this manner. Her</p>
<p>father grew worse; her time was more entirely oc-</p>
<p>cupied in attending him; her means of subsistence</p>
<p>decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in</p>
<p>her arms, leaving her an orphan and a beggar. This</p>
<p>last blow overcame her; and she knelt by Beaufort’s</p>
<p>cofﬁn, weeping bitterly, when my father entered the</p>
<p>chamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the</p>
<p>poor girl, who committed herself to his care, and</p>
<p>after the interment of his friend he conducted her</p>
<p>to Geneva, and placed her under the protection</p>
<p>of a relation. Two years after this event Caroline</p>
<p>became his wife.</p>
<p>When my father became a husband and a par-</p>
<p>ent, he found his time so occupied by the duties</p>
<p>of his new situation, that he relinquished many of</p>
<p>his public employments, and devoted himself to the</p>
<p>education of his children. Of these I was the eldest,</p>
<p>and the destined successor to all his labours and</p>
<p>utility. No creature could have more tender parents</p>
<p>than mine. My improvement and health were their</p>
<p>constant care, especially as I remained for several</p>
<p>years their only child. But before I continue my nar-</p>
<p>rative, I must record an incident which took place</p>
<p>when I was four years of age.</p>
<p>My father had a sister, whom he tenderly loved,</p>
<p>and who had married early in life an Italian gentle-</p>
<p>man. Soon after her marriage, she had accompa-</p>
<p>nied her husband into her native country, and for</p>
<p>some years my father had very little communication</p>
<p>with her. About the time I mentioned she died; and</p>
<p>a few months afterwards he received a letter from</p>
<p>her husband, acquainting him with his intention of</p>
<p>marrying an Italian lady, and requesting my father</p>
<p>to take charge of the infant Elizabeth, the only child</p>
<p>of his deceased sister. “It is my wish,” he said, “that</p>
<p>you should consider her as your own daughter, and</p>
<p>educate her thus. Her mother’s fortune is secured</p>
<p>to her, the documents of which I will commit to your</p>
<p>keeping. Reﬂect upon this proposition; and de-</p>
<p>cide whether you would prefer educating your niece</p>
<p>yourself to her being brought up by a stepmother.”</p>
<p>My father did not hestitate, and immediately</p>
<p>went to Italy, that he might accompany the little Eliz-</p>
<p>abeth to her future home. I have often heard my</p>
<p>mother say, that she was at that time the most beau-</p>
<p>tiful child she had ever seen, and shewed signs</p>
<p>even then of a gentle and affectionate disposition.</p>
<p>These indications, and a desire to bind as closely</p>
<p>as possible the ties of domestic love, determined</p>
<p>my mother to consider Elizabeth as my future wife;</p>
<p>a design which she never found reason to repent.</p>
<p>From this time Elizabeth Lavenza became my</p>
<p>playfellow, and, as we grew older, my friend. She</p>
<p>was docile and good tempered, yet gay and play-</p>
<p>ful as a summer insect. Although she was lively</p>
<p>and animated, her feelings were strong and deep,</p>
<p>and her disposition uncommonly affectionate. No</p>
<p>one could better enjoy liberty, yet no one could sub-</p>
<p>mit with more grace than she did to constraint and</p>
<p>caprice. Her imagination was luxuriant, yet her ca-</p>
<p>pability of application was great. Her person was</p>
<p>the image of her mind; her hazel eyes, although as</p>
<p>lively as a bird’s, possessed an attractive softness.</p>
<p>Her ﬁgure was light and airy; and, though capable</p>
<p>of enduring great fatigue, she appeared the most</p>
<p>fragile creature in the world. While I admired her</p>
<p>understanding and fancy, I loved to tend on her, as</p>
<p>I should on a favourite animal; and I never saw so</p>
<p>much grace both of person and mind united to so</p>
<p>little pretension.</p>
<p>Every one adored Elizabeth. If the servants</p>
<p>had any request to make, it was always through</p>
<p>her intercession. We were strangers to any species</p>
<p>of disunion and dispute; for although there was</p>
<p>a great dissimilitude in our characters, there was</p>
<p>an harmony in that very dissimilitude. I was more</p>
<p>calm and philosophical than my companion; yet my</p>
<p>temper was not so yielding. My application was of</p>
<p>longer endurance; but it was not so severe whilst</p>
<p>it endured. I delighted in investigating the facts</p>
<p>relative to the actual world; she busied herself in fol-</p>
<p>lowing the aërial creations of the poets. The world</p>
<p>was to me a secret, which I desired to discover; to</p>
<p>her it was a vacancy, which she sought to people</p>
<p>with imaginations of her own.</p>
<p>My brothers were considerably younger than</p>
<p>myself; but I had a friend in one of my schoolfel-</p>
<p>lows, who compensated for this deﬁciency. Henry</p>
<p>Clerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva, an</p>
<p>intimate friend of my father. He was a boy of sin-</p>
<p>gular talent and fancy. I remember, when he was</p>
<p>nine years old, he wrote a fairy tale, which was the</p>
<p>delight and amazement of all his companions. His</p>
<p>favourite study consisted in books of chivalry and</p>
<p>romance; and when very young, I can remember,</p>
<p>that we used to act plays composed by him out</p>
<p>of these favourite books, the principal characters</p>
<p>of which were Orlando, Robin Hood, Amadis, and</p>
<p>St. George.</p>
<p>No youth could have passed more happily than</p>
<p>mine. My parents were indulgent, and my compan-</p>
<p>ions amiable. Our studies were never forced; and</p>
<p>by some means we always had an end placed in</p>
<p>view, which excited us to ardour in the prosecution</p>
<p>of them. It was by this method, and not by emula-</p>
<p>tion, that we were urged to application. Elizabeth</p>
<p>was not incited to apply herself to drawing, that her</p>
<p>companions might not outstrip her; but through the</p>
<p>desire of pleasing her aunt, by the representation</p>
<p>of some favourite scene done by her own hand. We</p>
<p>learned Latin and English, that we might read the</p>
<p>writings in those languages; and so far from study</p>
<p>being made odious to us through punishment, we</p>
<p>loved application, and our amusements would have</p>
<p>been the labours of other children. Perhaps we</p>
<p>did not read so many books, or learn languages</p>
<p>so quickly, as those who are disciplined according</p>
<p>to the ordinary methods; but what we learned was</p>
<p>impressed the more deeply on our memories.</p>
<p>In this description of our domestic circle I in-</p>
<p>clude Henry Clerval; for he was constantly with us.</p>
<p>He went to school with me, and generally passed</p>
<p>the afternoon at our house; for being an only child,</p>
<p>and destitute of companions at home, his father</p>
<p>was well pleased that he should ﬁnd associates at</p>
<p>our house; and we were never completely happy</p>
<p>when Clerval was absent.</p>
<p>I feel pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of</p>
<p>childhood, before misfortune had tainted my mind,</p>
<p>and changed its bright visions of extensive useful-</p>
<p>ness into gloomy and narrow reﬂections upon self.</p>
<p>But, in drawing the picture of my early days, I must</p>
<p>not omit to record those events which led, by insen-</p>
<p>sible steps to my after tale of misery: for when I</p>
<p>would account to myself for the birth of that passion,</p>
<p>which afterwards ruled my destiny, I ﬁnd it arise, like</p>
<p>a mountain river, from ignoble and almost forgotten</p>
<p>sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became</p>
<p>the torrent which, in its course, has swept away all</p>
<p>my hopes and joys.</p>
<p>Natural philosophy is the genius that has reg-</p>
<p>ulated my fate; I desire therefore, in this narration,</p>
<p>to state those facts which led to my predilection for</p>
<p>that science. When I was thirteen years of age, we</p>
<p>all went on a party of pleasure to the baths near</p>
<p>Thonon: the inclemency of the weather obliged us</p>
<p>to remain a day conﬁned to the inn. In this house</p>
<p>I chanced to ﬁnd a volume of the works of Cor-</p>
<p>nelius Agrippa. I opened it with apathy; the theory</p>
<p>which he attempts to demonstrate, and the wonder-</p>
<p>ful facts which he relates, soon changed this feeling</p>
<p>into enthusiasm. A new light seemed to dawn upon</p>
<p>my mind; and, bounding with joy, I communicated</p>
<p>my discovery to my father. I cannot help remarking</p>
<p>here the many opportunities instructors possess</p>
<p>of directing the attention of their pupils to useful</p>
<p>knowledge, which they utterly neglect. My father</p>
<p>looked carelessly at the title-page of my book, and</p>
<p>said, “Ah! Cornelius Agrippa! My dear Victor, do</p>
<p>not waste your time upon this; it is sad trash.”</p>
<p>If, instead of this remark, my father had taken</p>
<p>the pains, to explain to me, that the principles of</p>
<p>Agrippa had been entirely exploded, and that a mod-</p>
<p>ern system of science had been introduced, which</p>
<p>possessed much greater powers than the ancient,</p>
<p>because the powers of the latter were chimerical,</p>
<p>while those of the former were real and practical;</p>
<p>under such circumstances, I should certainly have</p>
<p>thrown Agrippa aside, and, with my imagination</p>
<p>warmed as it was, should probably have applied my-</p>
<p>self to the more rational theory of chemistry which</p>
<p>has resulted from modern discoveries. It is even</p>
<p>possible, that the train of my ideas would never</p>
<p>have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin.</p>
<p>But the cursory glance my father had taken of my</p>
<p>volume by no means assured me that he was ac-</p>
<p>quainted with its contents; and I continued to read</p>
<p>with the greatest avidity.</p>
<p>When I returned home, my ﬁrst care was to</p>
<p>procure the whole works of this author, and after-</p>
<p>wards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read</p>
<p>and studied the wild fancies of these writers with</p>
<p>delight; they appeared to me treasures known to</p>
<p>few beside myself; and although I often wished to</p>
<p>communicate these secret stores of knowledge to</p>
<p>my father, yet his indeﬁnite censure of my favourite</p>
<p>Agrippa always withheld me. I disclosed my dis-</p>
<p>coveries to Elizabeth, therefore, under a promise of</p>
<p>strict secrecy; but she did not interest herself in the</p>
<p>subject, and I was left by her to pursue my studies</p>
<p>alone.</p>
<p>It may appear very strange, that a disciple of</p>
<p>Albertus Magnus should arise in the eighteenth cen-</p>
<p>tury; but our family was not scientiﬁcal, and I had</p>
<p>not attended any of the lectures given at the schools</p>
<p>of Geneva. My dreams were therefore undisturbed</p>
<p>by reality; and I entered with the greatest diligence</p>
<p>into the search of the philosopher’s stone and the</p>
<p>elixir of life. But the latter obtained my most undi-</p>
<p>vided attention: wealth was an inferior object; but</p>
<p>what glory would attend the discovery, if I could</p>
<p>banish disease from the human frame, and render</p>
<p>man invulnerable to any but a violent death!</p>
<p>Nor were these my only visions. The raising of</p>
<p>ghosts or devils was a promise liberally accorded</p>
<p>by my favourite authors, the fulﬁlment of which I</p>
<p>most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were</p>
<p>always unsuccessful, I attributed the failure rather</p>
<p>to my own inexperience and mistake, than to a want</p>
<p>of skill or ﬁdelity in my instructors.</p>
<p>The natural phænomena that take place ev-</p>
<p>ery day before our eyes did not escape my exam-</p>
<p>inations. Distillation, and the wonderful effects of</p>
<p>steam, processes of which my favourite authors</p>
<p>were utterly ignorant, excited my astonishment; but</p>
<p>my utmost wonder was engaged by some experi-</p>
<p>ments on an air-pump, which I saw employed by a</p>
<p>gentleman whom we were in the habit of visiting.</p>
<p>The ignorance of the early philosophers on</p>
<p>these and several other points served to decrease</p>
<p>their credit with me: but I could not entirely throw</p>
<p>them aside, before some other system should oc-</p>
<p>cupy their place in my mind.</p>
<p>When I was about ﬁfteen years old, we had re-</p>
<p>tired to our house near Belrive, when we witnessed</p>
<p>a most violent and terrible thunder-storm. It ad-</p>
<p>vanced from behind the mountains of Jura; and</p>
<p>the thunder burst at once with frightful loudness</p>
<p>from various quarters of the heavens. I remained,</p>
<p>while the storm lasted, watching its progress with</p>
<p>curiosity and delight. As I stood at the door, on a</p>
<p>sudden I beheld a stream of ﬁre issue from an old</p>
<p>and beautiful oak, which stood about twenty yards</p>
<p>from our house; and so soon as the dazzling light</p>
<p>vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing</p>
<p>remained but a blasted stump. When we visited it</p>
<p>the next morning, we found the tree shattered in a</p>
<p>singular manner. It was not splintered by the shock,</p>
<p>but entirely reduced to thin ribbands of wood. I</p>
<p>never beheld any thing so utterly destroyed.</p>
<p>The catastrophe of this tree excited my extreme</p>
<p>astonishment; and I eagerly inquired of my father</p>
<p>the nature and origin of thunder and lightning. He</p>
<p>replied, “Electricity;” describing at the same time</p>
<p>the various effects of that power. He constructed a</p>
<p>small electrical machine, and exhibited a few exper-</p>
<p>iments; he made also a kite, with a wire and string,</p>
<p>which drew down that ﬂuid from the clouds.</p>
<p>This last stroke completed the overthrow of Cor-</p>
<p>nelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus,</p>
<p>who had so long reigned the lords of my imagina-</p>
<p>tion. But by some fatality I did not feel inclined to</p>
<p>commence the study of any modern system; and</p>
<p>this disinclination was inﬂuenced by the following</p>
<p>circumstance.</p>
<p>My father expressed a wish that I should attend</p>
<p>a course of lectures upon natural philosophy, to</p>
<p>which I cheerfully consented. Some accident pre-</p>
<p>vented my attending these lectures until the course</p>
<p>was nearly ﬁnished. The lecture, being therefore</p>
<p>one of the last, was entirely incomprehensible to</p>
<p>me. The professor discoursed with the greatest</p>
<p>ﬂuency of potassium and boron, of sulphates and</p>
<p>oxyds, terms to which I could afﬁx no idea; and I</p>
<p>became disgusted with the science of natural phi-</p>
<p>losophy, although I still read Pliny and Buffon with</p>
<p>delight, authors, in my estimation, of nearly equal</p>
<p>interest and utility.</p>
<p>My occupations at this age were principally the</p>
<p>mathematics, and most of the branches of study</p>
<p>appertaining to that science. I was busily employed</p>
<p>in learning languages; Latin was already familiar</p>
<p>to me, and I began to read some of the easiest</p>
<p>Greek authors without the help of a lexicon. I also</p>
<p>perfectly understood English and German. This</p>
<p>is the list of my accomplishments at the age of</p>
<p>seventeen; and you may conceive that my hours</p>
<p>were fully employed in acquiring and maintaining a</p>
<p>knowledge of this various literature.</p>
<p>Another task also devolved upon me, when I</p>
<p>became the instructor of my brothers. Ernest was</p>
<p>six years younger than myself, and was my principal</p>
<p>pupil. He had been afﬂicted with ill health from his</p>
<p>infancy, through which Elizabeth and I had been his</p>
<p>constant nurses: his disposition was gentle, but he</p>
<p>was incapable of any severe application. William,</p>
<p>the youngest of our family, was yet an infant, and</p>
<p>the most beautiful little fellow in the world; his lively</p>
<p>blue eyes, dimpled cheeks, and endearing manners,</p>
<p>inspired the tenderest affection.</p>
<p>Such was our domestic circle, from which care</p>
<p>and pain seemed for ever banished. My father</p>
<p>directed our studies, and my mother partook of our</p>
<p>enjoyments. Neither of us possessed the slightest</p>
<p>pre-eminence over the other; the voice of command</p>
<p>was never heard amongst us; but mutual affection</p>
<p>engaged us all to comply with and obey the slightest</p>
<p>desire of each other.</p>
<p>Chapter II</p>
<p>WHEN I had attained the age of seventeen, my</p>
<p>parents resolved that I should become a student at</p>
<p>the university of Ingolstadt. I had hitherto attended</p>
<p>the schools of Geneva; but my father thought it</p>
<p>necessary, for the completion of my education, that</p>
<p>I should be made acquainted with other customs</p>
<p>than those of my native country. My departure was</p>
<p>therefore ﬁxed at an early date; but, before the day</p>
<p>resolved upon could arrive, the ﬁrst misfortune of</p>
<p>my life occurred — an omen, as it were, of my future</p>
<p>misery.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; but her</p>
<p>illness was not severe, and she quickly recovered.</p>
<p>During her conﬁnement, many arguments had been</p>
<p>urged to persuade my mother to refrain from at-</p>
<p>tending upon her. She had, at ﬁrst, yielded to our</p>
<p>entreaties; but when she heard that her favourite</p>
<p>was recovering, she could no longer debar herself</p>
<p>from her society, and entered her chamber long</p>
<p>before the danger of infection was past. The con-</p>
<p>sequences of this imprudence were fatal. On the</p>
<p>third day my mother sickened; her fever was very</p>
<p>malignant, and the looks of her attendants prognos-</p>
<p>ticated the worst event. On her death-bed the forti-</p>
<p>tude and benignity of this admirable woman did not</p>
<p>desert her. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and</p>
<p>myself: “My children,” she said, “my ﬁrmest hopes</p>
<p>of future happiness were placed on the prospect of</p>
<p>your union. This expectation will now be the conso-</p>
<p>lation of your father. Elizabeth, my love, you must</p>
<p>supply my place to your younger cousins. Alas! I</p>
<p>regret that I am taken from you; and, happy and</p>
<p>beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you</p>
<p>all? But these are not thoughts beﬁtting me; I will</p>
<p>endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to death, and</p>
<p>will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.”</p>
<p>She died calmly; and her countenance ex-</p>
<p>pressed affection even in death. I need not de-</p>
<p>scribe the feelings of those whose dearest ties</p>
<p>are rent by that most irreparable evil, the void that</p>
<p>presents itself to the soul, and the despair that is</p>
<p>exhibited on the countenance. It is so long before</p>
<p>the mind can persuade itself that she, whom we</p>
<p>saw every day, and whose very existence appeared</p>
<p>a part of our own, can have departed for ever —</p>
<p>that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been</p>
<p>extinguished, and the sound of a voice so familiar,</p>
<p>and dear to the ear, can be hushed, never more to</p>
<p>be heard. These are the reﬂections of the ﬁrst days;</p>
<p>but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the</p>
<p>evil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences.</p>
<p>Yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away</p>
<p>some dear connexion; and why should I describe a</p>
<p>sorrow which all have felt, and must feel? The time</p>
<p>at length arrives, when grief is rather an indulgence</p>
<p>than a necessity; and the smile that plays upon</p>
<p>the lips, although it may be deemed a sacrilege, is</p>
<p>not banished. My mother was dead, but we had</p>
<p>still duties which we ought to perform; we must</p>
<p>continue our course with the rest, and learn to think</p>
<p>ourselves fortunate, whilst one remains whom the</p>
<p>spoiler has not seized.</p>
<p>My journey to Ingolstadt, which had been de-</p>
<p>ferred by these events, was now again determined</p>
<p>upon. I obtained from my father a respite of some</p>
<p>weeks. This period was spent sadly; my mother’s</p>
<p>death, and my speedy departure, depressed our</p>
<p>spirits; but Elizabeth endeavoured to renew the</p>
<p>spirit of cheerfulness in our little society. Since the</p>
<p>death of her aunt, her mind had acquired new ﬁrm-</p>
<p>ness and vigour. She determined to fulﬁl her duties</p>
<p>with the greatest exactness; and she felt that that</p>
<p>most imperious duty, of rendering her uncle and</p>
<p>cousins happy, had devolved upon her. She con-</p>
<p>soled me, amused her uncle, instructed my broth-</p>
<p>ers; and I never beheld her so enchanting as at</p>
<p>this time, when she was continually endeavouring</p>
<p>to contribute to the happiness of others, entirely</p>
<p>forgetful of herself.</p>
<p>The day of my departure at length arrived. I</p>
<p>had taken leave of all my friends, excepting Clerval,</p>
<p>who spent the last evening with us. He bitterly</p>
<p>lamented that he was unable to accompany me: but</p>
<p>his father could not be persuaded to part with him,</p>
<p>intending that he should become a partner with him</p>
<p>in business, in compliance with his favourite theory,</p>
<p>that learning was superﬂuous in the commerce of</p>
<p>ordinary life. Henry had a reﬁned mind; he had no</p>
<p>desire to be idle, and was well pleased to become</p>
<p>his father’s partner, but he believed that a man</p>
<p>might be a very good trader, and yet possess a</p>
<p>cultivated understanding.</p>
<p>We sat late, listening to his complaints, and</p>
<p>making many little arrangements for the future. The</p>
<p>next morning early I departed. Tears gushed from</p>
<p>the eyes of Elizabeth; they proceeded partly from</p>
<p>sorrow at my departure, and partly because she</p>
<p>reﬂected that the same journey was to have taken</p>
<p>place three months before, when a mother’s bless-</p>
<p>ing would have accompanied me.</p>
<p>I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey</p>
<p>me away, and indulged in the most melancholy re-</p>
<p>ﬂections. I, who had ever been surrounded by ami-</p>
<p>able companions, continually engaged in endeav-</p>
<p>ouring to bestow mutual pleasure, I was now alone.</p>
<p>In the university, whither I was going, I must form</p>
<p>my own friends, and be my own protector. My life</p>
<p>had hitherto been remarkably secluded and domes-</p>
<p>tic; and this had given me invincible repugnance to</p>
<p>new countenances. I loved my brothers, Elizabeth,</p>
<p>and Clerval; these were “old familiar faces;” but</p>
<p>I believed myself totally unﬁtted for the company</p>
<p>of strangers. Such were my reﬂections as I com-</p>
<p>menced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits</p>
<p>and hopes rose. I ardently desired the acquisition</p>
<p>of knowledge. I had often, when at home, thought</p>
<p>it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one</p>
<p>place, and had longed to enter the world, and take</p>
<p>my station among other human beings. Now my</p>
<p>desires were complied with, and it would, indeed,</p>
<p>have been folly to repent.</p>
<p>I had sufﬁcient leisure for these and many other</p>
<p>reﬂections during my journey to Ingolstadt, which</p>
<p>was long and fatiguing. At length the high white</p>
<p>steeple of the town met my eyes. I alighted, and</p>
<p>was conducted to my solitary apartment, to spend</p>
<p>the evening as I pleased.</p>
<p>The next morning I delivered my letters of intro-</p>
<p>duction, and paid a visit to some of the principal</p>
<p>professors, and among others to M. Krempe, pro-</p>
<p>fessor of natural philosophy. He received me with</p>
<p>politeness, and asked me several questions con-</p>
<p>cerning my progress in the different branches of</p>
<p>science appertaining to natural philosophy. I men-</p>
<p>tioned, it is true, with fear and trembling, the only</p>
<p>authors I had ever read upon those subjects. The</p>
<p>professor stared: “Have you,” he said, “really spent</p>
<p>your time in studying such nonsense?”</p>
<p>I replied in the afﬁrmative. “Every minute,” con-</p>
<p>tinued M. Krempe with warmth, “every instant that</p>
<p>you have wasted on those books is utterly and en-</p>
<p>tirely lost. You have burdened your memory with</p>
<p>exploded systems, and useless names. Good God!</p>
<p>in what desert land have you lived, where no one</p>
<p>was kind enough to inform you that these fancies,</p>
<p>which you have so greedily imbibed, are a thousand</p>
<p>years old, and as musty as they are ancient? I little</p>
<p>expected in this enlightened and scientiﬁc age to</p>
<p>ﬁnd a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus.</p>
<p>My dear Sir, you must begin your studies entirely</p>
<p>anew.”</p>
<p>So saying, he stept aside, and wrote down a</p>
<p>list of several books treating of natural philosophy,</p>
<p>which he desired me to procure, and dismissed</p>
<p>me, after mentioning that in the beginning of the</p>
<p>following week he intended to commence a course</p>
<p>of lectures upon natural philosophy in its general</p>
<p>relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow-professor,</p>
<p>would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days</p>
<p>that he missed.</p>
<p>I returned home, not disappointed, for I had</p>
<p>long considered those authors useless whom the</p>
<p>professor had so strongly reprobated; but I did not</p>
<p>feel much inclined to study the books which I pro-</p>
<p>cured at his recommendation. M. Krempe was a</p>
<p>little squat man, with a gruff voice and repulsive</p>
<p>countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not pre-</p>
<p>possess me in favour of his doctrine. Besides, I had</p>
<p>a contempt for the uses of modern natural philoso-</p>
<p>phy. It was very different, when the masters of the</p>
<p>science sought immortality and power; such views,</p>
<p>although futile, were grand: but now the scene was</p>
<p>changed. The ambition of the inquirer seemed to</p>
<p>limit itself to the annihilation of those visions on</p>
<p>which my interest in science was chieﬂy founded. I</p>
<p>was required to exchange chimeras of boundless</p>
<p>grandeur for realities of little worth.</p>
<p>Such were my reﬂections during the ﬁrst two</p>
<p>or three days spent almost in solitude. But as the</p>
<p>ensuing week commenced, I thought of the infor-</p>
<p>mation which M. Krempe had given me concerning</p>
<p>the lectures. And although I could not consent to</p>
<p>go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sen-</p>
<p>tences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had</p>
<p>said of M. Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he</p>
<p>had hitherto been out of town.</p>
<p>Partly from curiosity, and partly from idleness,</p>
<p>I went into the lecturing room, which M. Waldman</p>
<p>entered shortly after. This professor was very un-</p>
<p>like his colleague. He appeared about ﬁfty years of</p>
<p>age, but with an aspect expressive of the greatest</p>
<p>benevolence; a few gray hairs covered his temples,</p>
<p>but those at the back of his head were nearly black.</p>
<p>His person was short, but remarkably erect; and</p>
<p>his voice the sweetest I had ever heard. He be-</p>
<p>gan his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of</p>
<p>chemistry and the various improvements made by</p>
<p>different men of learning, pronouncing with fervour</p>
<p>the names of the most distinguished discoverers.</p>
<p>He then took a cursory view of the present state</p>
<p>of the science, and explained many of its elemen-</p>
<p>tary terms. After having made a few preparatory</p>
<p>experiments, he concluded with a panegyric upon</p>
<p>modern chemistry, the terms of which I shall never</p>
<p>forget:—</p>
<p>“The ancient teachers of this science,” said he,</p>
<p>“promised impossibilities, and performed nothing.</p>
<p>The modern masters promise very little; they know</p>
<p>that metals cannot be transmuted, and that the elixir</p>
<p>of life is a chimera. But these philosophers, whose</p>
<p>hands seem only made to dabble in dirt, and their</p>
<p>eyes to pour over the microscope or crucible, have</p>
<p>indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into</p>
<p>the recesses of nature, and shew how she works</p>
<p>in her hiding places. They ascend into the heav-</p>
<p>ens; they have discovered how the blood circulates,</p>
<p>and the nature of the air we breathe. They have</p>
<p>acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they</p>
<p>can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the</p>
<p>earthquake, and even mock the invisible world with</p>
<p>its own shadows.”</p>
<p>I departed highly pleased with the professor and</p>
<p>his lecture, and paid him a visit the same evening.</p>
<p>His manners in private were even more mild and</p>
<p>attractive than in public; for there was a certain dig-</p>
<p>nity in his mien during his lecture, which in his own</p>
<p>house was replaced by the greatest affability and</p>
<p>kindness. He heard with attention my little narration</p>
<p>concerning my studies, and smiled at the names</p>
<p>of Cornelius Agrippa, and Paracelsus, but without</p>
<p>the contempt that M. Krempe had exhibited. He</p>
<p>said, that “these were men to whose indefatigable</p>
<p>zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most</p>
<p>of the foundations of their knowledge. They had</p>
<p>left to us, as an easier task, to give new names,</p>
<p>and arrange in connected classiﬁcations, the facts</p>
<p>which they in a great degree had been the instru-</p>
<p>ments of bringing to light. The labours of men</p>
<p>of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely</p>
<p>ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage</p>
<p>of mankind.” I listened to his statement, which was</p>
<p>delivered without any presumption or affectation;</p>
<p>and then added, that his lecture had removed my</p>
<p>prejudices against modern chemists; and I, at the</p>
<p>same time, requested his advice concerning the</p>
<p>books I ought to procure.</p>
<p>“I am happy,” said M. Waldman, “to have gained</p>
<p>a disciple; and if your application equals your ability,</p>
<p>I have no doubt of your success. Chemistry is that</p>
<p>branch of natural philosophy in which the greatest</p>
<p>improvements have been and may be made; it is</p>
<p>on that account that I have made it my peculiar</p>
<p>study; but at the same time I have not neglected</p>
<p>the other branches of science. A man would make</p>
<p>but a very sorry chemist, if he attended to that</p>
<p>department of human knowledge alone. If your</p>
<p>wish is to become really a man of science, and</p>
<p>not merely a petty experimentalist, I should advise</p>
<p>you to apply to every branch of natural philosophy,</p>
<p>including mathematics.”</p>
<p>He then took me into his laboratory, and ex-</p>
<p>plained to me the uses of his various machines;</p>
<p>instructing me as to what I ought to procure, and</p>
<p>promising me the use of his own, when I should</p>
<p>have advanced far enough in the science not to</p>
<p>derange their mechanism. He also gave me the</p>
<p>list of books which I had requested; and I took my</p>
<p>leave.</p>
<p>Thus ended a day memorable to me; it decided</p>
<p>my future destiny.</p>
<p>Chapter III</p>
<p>FROM this day natural philosophy, and particularly</p>
<p>chemistry, in the most comprehensive sense of the</p>
<p>term, became nearly my sole occupation. I read</p>
<p>with ardour those works, so full of genius and dis-</p>
<p>crimination, which modern inquirers have written</p>
<p>on these subjects. I attended the lectures, and culti-</p>
<p>vated the acquaintance, of the men of science of the</p>
<p>university; and I found even in M. Krempe a great</p>
<p>deal of sound sense and real information, com-</p>
<p>bined, it is true, with a repulsive physiognomy and</p>
<p>manners, but not on that account the less valuable.</p>
<p>In M. Waldman I found a true friend. His gentleness</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>was never tinged by dogmatism; and his instruc-</p>
<p>tions were given with an air of frankness and good</p>
<p>nature, that banished every idea of pedantry. It was,</p>
<p>perhaps, the amiable character of this man that in-</p>
<p>clined me more to that branch of natural philosophy</p>
<p>which he professed, than an intrinsic love for the</p>
<p>science itself. But this state of mind had place only</p>
<p>in the ﬁrst steps towards knowledge: the more fully</p>
<p>I entered into the science, the more exclusively I</p>
<p>pursued it for its own sake. That application, which</p>
<p>at ﬁrst had been a matter of duty and resolution,</p>
<p>now became so ardent and eager, that the stars</p>
<p>often disappeared in the light of morning whilst I</p>
<p>was yet engaged in my laboratory.</p>
<p>As I applied so closely, it may be easily con-</p>
<p>ceived that I improved rapidly. My ardour was in-</p>
<p>deed the astonishment of the students; and my</p>
<p>proﬁciency, that of the masters. Professor Krempe</p>
<p>often asked me, with a sly smile, how Cornelius</p>
<p>Agrippa went on? whilst M. Waldman expressed</p>
<p>the most heart-felt exultation in my progress. Two</p>
<p>years passed in this manner, during which I paid no</p>
<p>visit to Geneva, but was engaged, heart and soul,</p>
<p>in the pursuit of some discoveries, which I hoped</p>
<p>to make. None but those who have experienced</p>
<p>them can conceive of the enticements of science.</p>
<p>In other studies you go as far as others have gone</p>
<p>before you, and there is nothing more to know; but</p>
<p>in a scientiﬁc pursuit there is continual food for dis-</p>
<p>covery and wonder. A mind of moderate capacity,</p>
<p>which closely pursues one study, must infallibly ar-</p>
<p>rive at great proﬁciency in that study; and I, who</p>
<p>continually sought the attainment of one object of</p>
<p>pursuit, and was solely wrapt up in this, improved so</p>
<p>rapidly, that, at the end of two years, I made some</p>
<p>discoveries in the improvement of some chemical</p>
<p>instruments, which procured me great esteem and</p>
<p>admiration at the university. When I had arrived at</p>
<p>this point, and had become as well acquainted with</p>
<p>the theory and practice of natural philosophy as de-</p>
<p>pended on the lessons of any of the professors at</p>
<p>Ingolstadt, my residence there being no longer con-</p>
<p>ducive to my improvements, I thought of returning</p>
<p>to my friends and my native town, when an incident</p>
<p>happened that protracted my stay.</p>
<p>One of the phænonema which had peculiarly</p>
<p>attracted my attention was the structure of the hu-</p>
<p>man frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with</p>
<p>life. Whence, I often asked myself, did the princi-</p>
<p>ple of life proceed? It was a bold question, and</p>
<p>one which has ever been considered as a mys-</p>
<p>tery; yet with how many things are we upon the</p>
<p>brink of becoming acquainted, if cowardice or care-</p>
<p>lessness did not restrain our inquiries. I revolved</p>
<p>these circumstances in my mind, and determined</p>
<p>thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to</p>
<p>those branches of natural philosophy which relate</p>
<p>to physiology. Unless I had been animated by an</p>
<p>almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to</p>
<p>this study would have been irksome, and almost</p>
<p>intolerable. To examine the causes of life, we must</p>
<p>ﬁrst have recourse to death. I became acquainted</p>
<p>with the science of anatomy: but this was not suf-</p>
<p>ﬁcient; I must also observe the natural decay and</p>
<p>corruption of the human body. In my education</p>
<p>my father had taken the greatest precautions that</p>
<p>my mind should be impressed with no supernatural</p>
<p>horrors. I do not ever remember to have trembled</p>
<p>at a tale of superstition, or to have feared the ap-</p>
<p>parition of a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon</p>
<p>my fancy; and a church-yard was to me merely</p>
<p>the receptacle of bodies deprived of life, which,</p>
<p>from being the seat of beauty and strength, had</p>
<p>become food for the worm. Now I was led to ex-</p>
<p>amine the cause and progress of this decay, and</p>
<p>forced to spend days and nights in vaults and char-</p>
<p>nel houses. My attention was ﬁxed upon every</p>
<p>object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the</p>
<p>human feelings. I saw how the ﬁne form of man</p>
<p>was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption</p>
<p>of death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I</p>
<p>saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the</p>
<p>eye and brain. I paused, examining and analysing</p>
<p>all the minutiæ of causation, as exempliﬁed in the</p>
<p>change from life to death, and death to life, un-</p>
<p>til from the midst of this darkness a sudden light</p>
<p>broke in upon me — a light so brilliant and won-</p>
<p>drous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with</p>
<p>the immensity of the prospect which it illustrated, I</p>
<p>was surprised that among so many men of genius,</p>
<p>who had directed their inquiries towards the same</p>
<p>science, that I alone should be reserved to discover</p>
<p>so astonishing a secret.</p>
<p>Remember, I am not recording the vision of a</p>
<p>madman. The sun does not more certainly shine</p>
<p>in the heavens, than that which I now afﬁrm is</p>
<p>true. Some miracle might have produced it, yet</p>
<p>the stages of the discovery were distinct and proba-</p>
<p>ble. After days and nights of incredible labour and</p>
<p>fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of</p>
<p>generation and life; nay, more, I became myself ca-</p>
<p>pable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter.</p>
<p>The astonishment which I had at ﬁrst experi-</p>
<p>enced on this discovery soon gave place to delight</p>
<p>and rapture. After so much time spent in painful</p>
<p>labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires,</p>
<p>was the most gratifying consummation of my toils.</p>
<p>But this discovery was so great and overwhelming,</p>
<p>that all the steps by which I had been progressively</p>
<p>led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the re-</p>
<p>sult. What had been the study and desire of the</p>
<p>wisest men since the creation of the world, was</p>
<p>now within my grasp. Not that, like a magic scene,</p>
<p>it all opened upon me at once: the information I</p>
<p>had obtained was of a nature rather to direct my</p>
<p>endeavours so soon as I should point them towards</p>
<p>the object of my search, than to exhibit that ob-</p>
<p>ject already accomplished. I was like the Arabian</p>
<p>who had been buried with the dead, and found a</p>
<p>passage to life aided only by one glimmering, and</p>
<p>seemingly ineffectual light.</p>
<p>I see by your eagerness, and the wonder and</p>
<p>hope which your eyes express, my friend, that you</p>
<p>expect to be informed of the secret with which I am</p>
<p>acquainted; that cannot be: listen patiently until the</p>
<p>end of my story, and you will easily perceive why I</p>
<p>am reserved upon that subject. I will not lead you</p>
<p>on, unguarded and ardent as I then was, to your</p>
<p>destruction and infallible misery. Learn from me, if</p>
<p>not by my precepts, at least by my example, how</p>
<p>dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge, and</p>
<p>how much happier that man is who believes his</p>
<p>native town to be the world, than he who aspires to</p>
<p>become greater than his nature will allow.</p>
<p>When I found so astonishing a power placed</p>
<p>within my hands, I hesitated a long time concerning</p>
<p>the manner in which I should employ it. Although</p>
<p>I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation,</p>
<p>yet to prepare a frame for the reception of it, with all</p>
<p>its intricacies of ﬁbres, muscles, and veins, still re-</p>
<p>mained a work of inconceivable difﬁculty and labour.</p>
<p>I doubted at ﬁrst whether I should attempt the cre-</p>
<p>ation of a being like myself or one of simpler orga-</p>
<p>nization; but my imagination was too much exalted</p>
<p>by my ﬁrst success to permit me to doubt of my</p>
<p>ability to give life to an animal as complex and won-</p>
<p>derful as man. The materials at present within my</p>
<p>command hardly appeared adequate to so arduous</p>
<p>an undertaking; but I doubted not that I should ulti-</p>
<p>mately succeed. I prepared myself for a multitude</p>
<p>of reverses; my operations might be incessantly baf-</p>
<p>ﬂed, and at last my work be imperfect: yet, when I</p>
<p>considered the improvement which every day takes</p>
<p>place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged</p>
<p>to hope my present attempts would at least lay the</p>
<p>foundations of future success. Nor could I con-</p>
<p>sider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as</p>
<p>any argument of its impracticability. It was with</p>
<p>these feelings that I began the creation of a human</p>
<p>being. As the minuteness of the parts formed a</p>
<p>great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary</p>
<p>to my ﬁrst intention, to make the being of a gigantic</p>
<p>stature; that is to say, about eight feet in height,</p>
<p>and proportionably large. After having formed this</p>
<p>determination, and having spent some months in</p>
<p>successfully collecting and arranging my materials,</p>
<p>I began.</p>
<p>No one can conceive the variety of feelings</p>
<p>which bore me onwards, like a hurricane, in the ﬁrst</p>
<p>enthusiasm of success. Life and death appeared to</p>
<p>me ideal bounds, which I should ﬁrst break through,</p>
<p>and pour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new</p>
<p>species would bless me as its creator and source;</p>
<p>many happy and excellent natures would owe their</p>
<p>being to me. No father could claim the gratitude of</p>
<p>his child so completely as I should deserve their’s.</p>
<p>Pursuing these reﬂections, I thought, that if I could</p>
<p>bestow animation upon lifeless matter, I might in</p>
<p>process of time (although I now found it impossible)</p>
<p>renew life where death had apparently devoted the</p>
<p>body to corruption.</p>
<p>These thoughts supported my spirits, while I</p>
<p>pursued my undertaking with unremitting ardour.</p>
<p>My cheek had grown pale with study, and my person</p>
<p>had become emaciated with conﬁnement. Some-</p>
<p>times, on the very brink of certainty, I failed; yet still</p>
<p>I clung to the hope which the next day or the next</p>
<p>hour might realize. One secret which I alone pos-</p>
<p>sessed was the hope to which I had dedicated my-</p>
<p>self; and the moon gazed on my midnight labours,</p>
<p>while, with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness,</p>
<p>I pursued nature to her hiding places. Who shall</p>
<p>conceive the horrors of my secret toil, as I dab-</p>
<p>bled among the unhallowed damps of the grave,</p>
<p>or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless</p>
<p>clay? My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with</p>
<p>the remembrance; but then a resistless, and almost</p>
<p>frantic impulse, urged me forward; I seemed to have</p>
<p>lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit. It</p>
<p>was indeed but a passing trance, that only made</p>
<p>me feel with renewed acuteness so soon as, the un-</p>
<p>natural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had returned</p>
<p>to my old habits. I collected bones from charnel</p>
<p>houses; and disturbed, with profane ﬁngers, the</p>
<p>tremendous secrets of the human frame. In a soli-</p>
<p>tary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house,</p>
<p>and separated from all the other apartments by a</p>
<p>gallery and staircase, I kept my workshop of ﬁlthy</p>
<p>creation; my eyeballs were starting from their sock-</p>
<p>ets in attending to the details of my employment.</p>
<p>The dissecting room and the slaughter-house fur-</p>
<p>nished many of my materials; and often did my</p>
<p>human nature turn with loathing from my occupa-</p>
<p>tion, whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which</p>
<p>perpetually increased, I brought my work near to a</p>
<p>conclusion.</p>
<p>The summer months passed while I was thus</p>
<p>engaged, heart and soul, in one pursuit. It was a</p>
<p>most beautiful season; never did the ﬁelds bestow</p>
<p>a more plentiful harvest, or the vines yield a more</p>
<p>luxuriant vintage: but my eyes were insensible to</p>
<p>the charms of nature. And the same feelings which</p>
<p>made me neglect the scenes around me caused</p>
<p>me also to forget those friends who were so many</p>
<p>miles absent, and whom I had not seen for so long a</p>
<p>time. I knew my silence disquieted them; and I well</p>
<p>remembered the words of my father: “I know that</p>
<p>while you are pleased with yourself, you will think</p>
<p>of us with affection, and we shall hear regularly</p>
<p>from you. You must pardon me, if I regard any</p>
<p>interruption in your correspondence as a proof that</p>
<p>your other duties are equally neglected.”</p>
<p>I knew well therefore what would be my fa-</p>
<p>ther’s feelings; but I could not tear my thoughts</p>
<p>from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which</p>
<p>had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination. I</p>
<p>wished, as it were, to procrastinate all that related to</p>
<p>my feelings of affection until the great object, which</p>
<p>swallowed up every habit of my nature, should be</p>
<p>completed.</p>
<p>I then thought that my father would be unjust if</p>
<p>he ascribed my neglect to vice, or faultiness on my</p>
<p>part; but I am now convinced that he was justiﬁed</p>
<p>in conceiving that I should not be altogether free</p>
<p>from blame. A human being in perfection ought</p>
<p>always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind, and</p>
<p>never to allow passion or a transitory desire to dis-</p>
<p>turb his tranquillity. I do not think that the pursuit</p>
<p>of knowledge is an exception to this rule. If the</p>
<p>study to which you apply yourself has a tendency</p>
<p>to weaken your affections, and to destroy your taste</p>
<p>for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can</p>
<p>possibly mix, then that study is certainly unlawful,</p>
<p>that is to say, not beﬁtting the human mind. If this</p>
<p>rule were always observed; if no man allowed any</p>
<p>pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity</p>
<p>of his domestic affections, Greece had not been</p>
<p>enslaved; Cæsar would have spared his country;</p>
<p>America would have been discovered more gradu-</p>
<p>ally; and the empires of Mexico and Peru had not</p>
<p>been destroyed.</p>
<p>But I forget that I am moralizing in the most</p>
<p>interesting part of my tale; and your looks remind</p>
<p>me to proceed.</p>
<p>My father made no reproach in his letters; and</p>
<p>only took notice of my silence by inquiring into my</p>
<p>occupations more particularly than before. Win-</p>
<p>ter, spring, and summer, passed away during my</p>
<p>labours; but I did not watch the blossom or the</p>
<p>expanding leaves — sights which before always</p>
<p>yielded me supreme delight, so deeply was I en-</p>
<p>grossed in my occupation. The leaves of that year</p>
<p>had withered before my work drew near to a close;</p>
<p>and now every day shewed me more plainly how</p>
<p>well I had succeeded. But my enthusiasm was</p>
<p>checked by my anxiety, and I appeared rather like</p>
<p>one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any</p>
<p>other unwholesome trade, than an artist occupied</p>
<p>by his favourite employment. Every night I was op-</p>
<p>pressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a</p>
<p>most painful degree; a disease that I regretted the</p>
<p>more because I had hitherto enjoyed most excellent</p>
<p>health, and had always boasted of the ﬁrmness of</p>
<p>my nerves. But I believed that exercise and amuse-</p>
<p>ment would soon drive away such symptoms; and I</p>
<p>promised myself both of these, when my creation</p>
<p>should be complete.</p>
<p>Chapter IV</p>
<p>IT was on a dreary night of November, that I beheld</p>
<p>the accomplishment of my toils. With an anxiety</p>
<p>that almost amounted to agony, I collected the in-</p>
<p>struments of life around me, that I might infuse a</p>
<p>spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my</p>
<p>feet. It was already one in the morning; the rain</p>
<p>pattered dismally against the panes, and my can-</p>
<p>dle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer</p>
<p>of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow</p>
<p>eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a</p>
<p>convulsive motion agitated its limbs.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>How can I describe my emotions at this catas-</p>
<p>trophe, or how delineate the wretch whom with such</p>
<p>inﬁnite pains and care I had endeavoured to form?</p>
<p>His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his</p>
<p>features as beautiful. Beautiful! — Great God! His</p>
<p>yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles</p>
<p>and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous</p>
<p>black, and ﬂowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness;</p>
<p>but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid</p>
<p>contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost</p>
<p>of the same colour as the dun white sockets in</p>
<p>which they were set, his shrivelled complexion, and</p>
<p>straight black lips.</p>
<p>The different accidents of life are not so change-</p>
<p>able as the feelings of human nature. I had worked</p>
<p>hard for nearly two years, for the sole purpose of</p>
<p>infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had</p>
<p>deprived myself of rest and health. I had desired</p>
<p>it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but</p>
<p>now that I had ﬁnished, the beauty of the dream</p>
<p>vanished, and breathless horror and disgust ﬁlled</p>
<p>my heart. Unable to endure the aspect of the being</p>
<p>I had created, I rushed out of the room, and contin-</p>
<p>ued a long time traversing my bed-chamber, unable</p>
<p>to compose my mind to sleep. At length lassitude</p>
<p>succeeded to the tumult I had before endured; and</p>
<p>I threw myself on the bed in my clothes, endeavour-</p>
<p>ing to seek a few moments of forgetfulness. But it</p>
<p>was in vain: I slept indeed, but I was disturbed by</p>
<p>the wildest dreams. I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the</p>
<p>bloom of health, walking in the streets of Ingolstadt.</p>
<p>Delighted and surprised, I embraced her; but as</p>
<p>I imprinted the ﬁrst kiss on her lips, they became</p>
<p>livid with the hue of death; her features appeared</p>
<p>to change, and I thought that I held the corpse of</p>
<p>my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped</p>
<p>her form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in</p>
<p>the folds of the ﬂannel. I started from my sleep</p>
<p>with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my</p>
<p>teeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed;</p>
<p>when, by the dim and yellow light of the moon, as</p>
<p>it forced its way through the window-shutters, I be-</p>
<p>held the wretch — the miserable monster whom I</p>
<p>had created. He held up the curtain of the bed; and</p>
<p>his eyes, if eyes they may be called, were ﬁxed on</p>
<p>me. His jaws opened, and he muttered some inar-</p>
<p>ticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks.</p>
<p>He might have spoken, but I did not hear; one hand</p>
<p>was stretched out, seemingly to detain me, but I</p>
<p>escaped, and rushed down stairs. I took refuge</p>
<p>in the court-yard belonging to the house which I</p>
<p>inhabited; where I remained during the rest of the</p>
<p>night, walking up and down in the greatest agita-</p>
<p>tion, listening attentively, catching and fearing each</p>
<p>sound as if it were to announce the approach of</p>
<p>the demoniacal corpse to which I had so miserably</p>
<p>given life.</p>
<p>Oh! no mortal could support the horror of that</p>
<p>countenance. A mummy again endued with anima-</p>
<p>tion could not be so hideous as that wretch. I had</p>
<p>gazed on him while unﬁnished; he was ugly then;</p>
<p>but when those muscles and joints were rendered</p>
<p>capable of motion, it became a thing such as even</p>
<p>Dante could not have conceived.</p>
<p>I passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my</p>
<p>pulse beat so quickly and hardly, that I felt the pal-</p>
<p>pitation of every artery; at others, I nearly sank to</p>
<p>the ground through languor and extreme weakness.</p>
<p>Mingled with this horror, I felt the bitterness of dis-</p>
<p>appointment: dreams that had been my food and</p>
<p>pleasant rest for so long a space, were now be-</p>
<p>come a hell to me; and the change was so rapid,</p>
<p>the overthrow so complete!</p>
<p>Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned,</p>
<p>and discovered to my sleepless and aching eyes</p>
<p>the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple and clock,</p>
<p>which indicated the sixth hour. The porter opened</p>
<p>the gates of the court, which had that night been</p>
<p>my asylum, and I issued into the streets, pacing</p>
<p>them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the</p>
<p>wretch whom I feared every turning of the street</p>
<p>would present to my view. I did not dare return to</p>
<p>the apartment which I inhabited, but felt impelled to</p>
<p>hurry on, although wetted by the rain, which poured</p>
<p>from a black and comfortless sky.</p>
<p>I continued walking in this manner for some</p>
<p>time, endeavouring, by bodily exercise, to ease the</p>
<p>load that weighed upon my mind. I traversed the</p>
<p>streets, without any clear conception of where I</p>
<p>was, or what I was doing. My heart palpitated in</p>
<p>the sickness of fear; and I hurried on with irregular</p>
<p>steps, not daring to look about me:</p>
<p>Like one who, on a lonely road,</p>
<p>Doth walk in fear and dread,</p>
<p>And, having once turn’d round, walks on,</p>
<p>And turns no more his head;</p>
<p>Because he knows a frightful ﬁend</p>
<p>Doth close behind him tread.</p>
<p>Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to</p>
<p>the inn at which the various diligences and car-</p>
<p>riages usually stopped. Here I paused, I knew not</p>
<p>why; but I remained some minutes with my eyes</p>
<p>ﬁxed on a coach that was coming towards me from</p>
<p>the other end of the street. As it drew nearer, I</p>
<p>observed that it was the Swiss diligence: it stopped</p>
<p>just where I was standing; and, on the door being</p>
<p>opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing</p>
<p>me, instantly sprung out. “My dear Frankenstein,”</p>
<p>exclaimed he, “how glad I am to see you! how for-</p>
<p>tunate that you should be here at the very moment</p>
<p>of my alighting!”</p>
<p>Nothing could equal my delight on seeing Cler-</p>
<p>val; his presence brought back to my thoughts my</p>
<p>father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so</p>
<p>dear to my recollection. I grasped his hand, and</p>
<p>in a moment forgot my horror and misfortune; I felt</p>
<p>suddenly, and for the ﬁrst time during many months,</p>
<p>calm and serene joy. I welcomed my friend, there-</p>
<p>fore, in the most cordial manner, and we walked</p>
<p>towards my college. Clerval continued talking for</p>
<p>some time about our mutual friends, and his own</p>
<p>good fortune in being permitted to come to Ingol-</p>
<p>stadt. “You may easily believe,” said he, “how great</p>
<p>was the difﬁculty to persuade my father that it was</p>
<p>not absolutely necessary for a merchant not to un-</p>
<p>derstand any thing except book-keeping; and, in-</p>
<p>deed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for</p>
<p>his constant answer to my unwearied entreaties</p>
<p>was the same as that of the Dutch schoolmaster</p>
<p>in the Vicar of Wakeﬁeld: ‘I have ten thousand</p>
<p>ﬂorins a year without Greek, I eat heartily without</p>
<p>Greek.’ But his affection for me at length overcame</p>
<p>his dislike of learning, and he has permitted me</p>
<p>to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of</p>
<p>knowledge.”</p>
<p>“It gives me the greatest delight to see you;</p>
<p>but tell me how you left my father, brothers, and</p>
<p>Elizabeth.”</p>
<p>“Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy</p>
<p>that they hear from you so seldom. By the bye,</p>
<p>I mean to lecture you a little upon their account</p>
<p>myself. — But, my dear Frankenstein,” continued</p>
<p>he, stopping short, and gazing full in my face, “I did</p>
<p>not before remark how very ill you appear; so thin</p>
<p>and pale; you look as if you had been watching for</p>
<p>several nights.”</p>
<p>“You have guessed right; I have lately been so</p>
<p>deeply engaged in one occupation, that I have not</p>
<p>allowed myself sufﬁcient rest, as you see: but I</p>
<p>hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments</p>
<p>are now at an end, and that I am at length free.”</p>
<p>I trembled excessively; I could not endure to</p>
<p>think of, and far less to allude to the occurrences</p>
<p>of the preceding night. I walked with a quick pace,</p>
<p>and we soon arrived at my college. I then reﬂected,</p>
<p>and the thought made me shiver, that the creature</p>
<p>whom I had left in my apartment might still be there,</p>
<p>alive, and walking about. I dreaded to behold this</p>
<p>monster; but I feared still more that Henry should</p>
<p>see him. Entreating him therefore to remain a few</p>
<p>minutes at the bottom of the stairs, I darted up</p>
<p>towards my own room. My hand was already on the</p>
<p>lock of the door before I recollected myself. I then</p>
<p>paused; and a cold shivering came over me. I threw</p>
<p>the door forcibly open, as children are accustomed</p>
<p>to do when they expect a spectre to stand in waiting</p>
<p>for them on the other side; but nothing appeared.</p>
<p>I stepped fearfully in: the apartment was empty;</p>
<p>and my bedroom was also freed from its hideous</p>
<p>guest. I could hardly believe that so great a good-</p>
<p>fortune could have befallen me; but when I became</p>
<p>assured that my enemy had indeed ﬂed, I clapped</p>
<p>my hands for joy, and ran down to Clerval.</p>
<p>We ascended into my room, and the servant</p>
<p>presently brought breakfast; but I was unable to con-</p>
<p>tain myself. It was not joy only that possessed me;</p>
<p>I felt my ﬂesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness,</p>
<p>and my pulse beat rapidly. I was unable to remain</p>
<p>for a single instant in the same place; I jumped over</p>
<p>the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud.</p>
<p>Clerval at ﬁrst attributed my unusual spirits to joy</p>
<p>on his arrival; but when he observed me more at-</p>
<p>tentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes for which</p>
<p>he could not account; and my loud, unrestrained,</p>
<p>heartless laughter, frightened and astonished him.</p>
<p>“My dear Victor,” cried he, “what, for God’s sake,</p>
<p>is the matter? Do not laugh in that manner. How ill</p>
<p>you are! What is the cause of all this?”</p>
<p>“Do not ask me,” cried I, putting my hands be-</p>
<p>fore my eyes, for I thought I saw the dreaded spec-</p>
<p>tre glide into the room; “he can tell. — Oh, save</p>
<p>me! save me!” I imagined that the monster seized</p>
<p>me; I struggled furiously, and fell down in a ﬁt.</p>
<p>Poor Clerval! what must have been his feelings?</p>
<p>A meeting, which he anticipated with such joy, so</p>
<p>strangely turned to bitterness. But I was not the</p>
<p>witness of his grief; for I was lifeless, and did not</p>
<p>recover my senses for a long, long time.</p>
<p>This was the commencement of a nervous fever,</p>
<p>which conﬁned me for several months. During</p>
<p>all that time Henry was my only nurse. I after-</p>
<p>wards learned that, knowing my father’s advanced</p>
<p>age, and unﬁtness for so long a journey, and how</p>
<p>wretched my sickness would make Elizabeth, he</p>
<p>spared them this grief by concealing the extent of</p>
<p>my disorder. He knew that I could not have a more</p>
<p>kind and attentive nurse than himself; and, ﬁrm in</p>
<p>the hope he felt of my recovery, he did not doubt</p>
<p>that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kind-</p>
<p>est action that he could towards them.</p>
<p>But I was in reality very ill; and surely noth-</p>
<p>ing but the unbounded and unremitting attentions</p>
<p>of my friend could have restored me to life. The</p>
<p>form of the monster on whom I had bestowed ex-</p>
<p>istence was for ever before my eyes, and I raved</p>
<p>incessantly concerning him. Doubtless my words</p>
<p>surprised Henry: he at ﬁrst believed them to be</p>
<p>the wanderings of my disturbed imagination; but</p>
<p>the pertinacity with which I continually recurred to</p>
<p>the same subject persuaded him that my disorder</p>
<p>indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and ter-</p>
<p>rible event.</p>
<p>By very slow degrees, and with frequent re-</p>
<p>lapses, that alarmed and grieved my friend, I recov-</p>
<p>ered. I remember the ﬁrst time I became capable of</p>
<p>observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure,</p>
<p>I perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared,</p>
<p>and that the young buds were shooting forth from</p>
<p>the trees that shaded my window. It was a divine</p>
<p>spring; and the season contributed greatly to my</p>
<p>convalescence. I felt also sentiments of joy and af-</p>
<p>fection revive in my bosom; my gloom disappeared,</p>
<p>and in a short time I became as cheerful as before</p>
<p>I was attacked by the fatal passion.</p>
<p>“Dearest Clerval,” exclaimed I, “how kind, how</p>
<p>very good you are to me. This whole winter, instead</p>
<p>of being spent in study, as you promised yourself,</p>
<p>has been consumed in my sick room. How shall I</p>
<p>ever repay you? I feel the greatest remorse for the</p>
<p>disappointment of which I have been the occasion;</p>
<p>but you will forgive me.”</p>
<p>“You will repay me entirely, if you do not discom-</p>
<p>pose yourself, but get well as fast as you can; and</p>
<p>since you appear in such good spirits, I may speak</p>
<p>to you on one subject, may I not?”</p>
<p>I trembled. One subject! what could it be?</p>
<p>Could he allude to an object on whom I dared not</p>
<p>even think?</p>
<p>“Compose yourself,” said Clerval, who observed</p>
<p>my change of colour, “I will not mention it, if it agi-</p>
<p>tates you; but your father and cousin would be very</p>
<p>happy if they received a letter from you in your own</p>
<p>hand-writing. They hardly know how ill you have</p>
<p>been, and are uneasy at your long silence.”</p>
<p>“Is that all? my dear Henry. How could you</p>
<p>suppose that my ﬁrst thought would not ﬂy towards</p>
<p>those dear, dear friends whom I love, and who are</p>
<p>so deserving of my love.”</p>
<p>“If this is your present temper, my friend, you</p>
<p>will perhaps be glad to see a letter that has been</p>
<p>lying here some days for you: it is from your cousin,</p>
<p>I believe.”</p>
<p>Chapter V</p>
<p>CLERVAL then put the following letter into my hands.</p>
<p>“To V. FRANKENSTEIN.</p>
<p>“MY DEAR COUSIN,</p>
<p>“I cannot describe to you the uneasiness we</p>
<p>have all felt concerning your health. We cannot</p>
<p>help imagining that your friend Clerval conceals the</p>
<p>extent of your disorder: for it is now several months</p>
<p>since we have seen your hand-writing; and all this</p>
<p>time you have been obliged to dictate your letters</p>
<p>91</p>
<p>to Henry. Surely, Victor, you must have been ex-</p>
<p>ceedingly ill; and this makes us all very wretched,</p>
<p>as much so nearly as after the death of your dear</p>
<p>mother. My uncle was almost persuaded that you</p>
<p>were indeed dangerously ill, and could hardly be</p>
<p>restrained from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt.</p>
<p>Clerval always writes that you are getting better; I</p>
<p>eagerly hope that you will conﬁrm this intelligence</p>
<p>soon in your own hand-writing; for indeed, indeed,</p>
<p>Victor, we are all very miserable on this account.</p>
<p>Relieve us from this fear, and we shall be the hap-</p>
<p>piest creatures in the world. Your father’s health is</p>
<p>now so vigorous, that he appears ten years younger</p>
<p>since last winter. Ernest also is so much improved,</p>
<p>that you would hardly know him: he is now nearly</p>
<p>sixteen, and has lost that sickly appearance which</p>
<p>he had some years ago; he is grown quite robust</p>
<p>and active.</p>
<p>“My uncle and I conversed a long time last night</p>
<p>about what profession Ernest should follow. His</p>
<p>constant illness when young has deprived him of</p>
<p>the habits of application; and now that he enjoys</p>
<p>good health, he is continually in the open air, climb-</p>
<p>ing the hills, or rowing on the lake. I therefore pro-</p>
<p>posed that he should be a farmer; which you know,</p>
<p>Cousin, is a favourite scheme of mine. A farmer’s</p>
<p>is a very healthy happy life; and the least hurtful,</p>
<p>or rather the most beneﬁcial profession of any. My</p>
<p>uncle had an idea of his being educated as an ad-</p>
<p>vocate, that through his interest he might become</p>
<p>a judge. But, besides that he is not at all ﬁtted for</p>
<p>such an occupation, it is certainly more creditable to</p>
<p>cultivate the earth for the sustenance of man, than</p>
<p>to be the conﬁdant, and sometimes the accomplice,</p>
<p>of his vices; which is the profession of a lawyer. I</p>
<p>said, that the employments of a prosperous farmer,</p>
<p>if they were not a more honourable, they were at</p>
<p>least a happier species of occupation than that of</p>
<p>a judge, whose misfortune it was always to med-</p>
<p>dle with the dark side of human nature. My uncle</p>
<p>smiled, and said, that I ought to be an advocate</p>
<p>myself, which put an end to the conversation on</p>
<p>that subject.</p>
<p>“And now I must tell you a little story that will</p>
<p>please, and perhaps amuse you. Do you not re-</p>
<p>member Justine Moritz? Probably you do not; I</p>
<p>will relate her history, therefore, in a few words.</p>
<p>Madame Moritz, her mother, was a widow with</p>
<p>four children, of whom Justine was the third. This</p>
<p>girl had always been the favourite of her father;</p>
<p>but, through a strange perversity, her mother could</p>
<p>not endure her, and, after the death of M. Moritz,</p>
<p>treated her very ill. My aunt observed this; and,</p>
<p>when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on</p>
<p>her mother to allow her to live at her house. The</p>
<p>republican institutions of our country have produced</p>
<p>simpler and happier manners than those which pre-</p>
<p>vail in the great monarchies that surround it. Hence</p>
<p>there is less distinction between the several classes</p>
<p>of its inhabitants; and the lower orders being nei-</p>
<p>ther so poor nor so despised, their manners are</p>
<p>more reﬁned and moral. A servant in Geneva does</p>
<p>not mean the same thing as a servant in France</p>
<p>and England. Justine, thus received in our family,</p>
<p>learned the duties of a servant; a condition which,</p>
<p>in our fortunate country, does not include the idea of</p>
<p>ignorance, and a sacriﬁce of the dignity of a human</p>
<p>being.</p>
<p>“After what I have said, I dare say you well re-</p>
<p>member the heroine of my little tale: for Justine was</p>
<p>a great favourite of your’s; and I recollect you once</p>
<p>remarked, that if you were in an ill humour, one</p>
<p>glance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same</p>
<p>reason that Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of</p>
<p>Angelica — she looked so frank-hearted and happy.</p>
<p>My aunt conceived a great attachment for her, by</p>
<p>which she was induced to give her an education su-</p>
<p>perior to that which she had at ﬁrst intended. This</p>
<p>beneﬁt was fully repaid; Justine was the most grate-</p>
<p>ful little creature in the world: I do not mean that she</p>
<p>made any professions, I never heard one pass her</p>
<p>lips; but you could see by her eyes that she almost</p>
<p>adored her protectress. Although her disposition</p>
<p>was gay, and in many respects inconsiderate, yet</p>
<p>she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of</p>
<p>my aunt. She thought her the model of all excel-</p>
<p>lence, and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology</p>
<p>and manners, so that even now she often reminds</p>
<p>me of her.</p>
<p>“When my dearest aunt died, every one was</p>
<p>too much occupied in their own grief to notice poor</p>
<p>Justine, who had attended her during her illness</p>
<p>with the most anxious affection. Poor Justine was</p>
<p>very ill; but other trials were reserved for her.</p>
<p>“One by one, her brothers and sister died; and</p>
<p>her mother, with the exception of her neglected</p>
<p>daughter, was left childless. The conscience of</p>
<p>the woman was troubled; she began to think that</p>
<p>the deaths of her favourites was a judgment from</p>
<p>heaven to chastise her partiality. She was a Roman</p>
<p>Catholic; and I believe her confessor conﬁrmed the</p>
<p>idea which she had conceived. Accordingly, a few</p>
<p>months after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine</p>
<p>was called home by her repentant mother. Poor</p>
<p>girl! she wept when she quitted our house: she was</p>
<p>much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had</p>
<p>given softness and a winning mildness to her man-</p>
<p>ners, which had before been remarkable for vivacity.</p>
<p>Nor was her residence at her mother’s house of a</p>
<p>nature to restore her gaiety. The poor woman was</p>
<p>very vacillating in her repentance. She sometimes</p>
<p>begged Justine to forgive her unkindness, but much</p>
<p>oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of</p>
<p>her brothers and sister. Perpetual fretting at length</p>
<p>threw Madame Moritz into a decline, which at ﬁrst</p>
<p>increased her irritability, but she is now at peace</p>
<p>for ever. She died on the ﬁrst approach of cold</p>
<p>weather, at the beginning of this last winter. Justine</p>
<p>has returned to us; and I assure you I love her ten-</p>
<p>derly. She is very clever and gentle, and extremely</p>
<p>pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her</p>
<p>expressions continually remind me of my dear aunt.</p>
<p>“I must say also a few words to you, my dear</p>
<p>cousin, of little darling William. I wish you could see</p>
<p>him; he is very tall of his age, with sweet laughing</p>
<p>blue eyes, dark eye-lashes, and curling hair. When</p>
<p>he smiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek,</p>
<p>which are rosy with health. He has already had one</p>
<p>or two little wives, but Louisa Biron is his favourite,</p>
<p>a pretty little girl of ﬁve years of age.</p>
<p>“Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be</p>
<p>indulged in a little gossip concerning the good peo-</p>
<p>ple of Geneva. The pretty Miss Mansﬁeld has al-</p>
<p>ready received the congratulatory visits on her ap-</p>
<p>proaching marriage with a young Englishman, John</p>
<p>Melbourne, Esq. Her ugly sister, Manon, married</p>
<p>M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn. Your</p>
<p>favourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered</p>
<p>several misfortunes since the departure of Clerval</p>
<p>from Geneva. But he has already recovered his spir-</p>
<p>its, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a</p>
<p>very lively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier.</p>
<p>She is a widow, and much older than Manoir; but</p>
<p>she is very much admired, and a favourite with</p>
<p>every body.</p>
<p>“I have written myself into good spirits, dear</p>
<p>cousin; yet I cannot conclude without again anx-</p>
<p>iously inquiring concerning your health. Dear Victor,</p>
<p>if you are not very ill, write yourself, and make your</p>
<p>father and all of us happy; or —— I cannot bear</p>
<p>to think of the other side of the question; my tears</p>
<p>already ﬂow. Adieu, my dearest cousin.”</p>
<p>“ELIZABETH LAVENZA.</p>
<p>“Geneva, March 18th, 17— .”</p>
<p>“Dear, dear Elizabeth!” I exclaimed when I had</p>
<p>read her letter, “I will write instantly, and relieve</p>
<p>them from the anxiety they must feel.” I wrote, and</p>
<p>this exertion greatly fatigued me; but my convales-</p>
<p>cence had commenced, and proceeded regularly.</p>
<p>In another fortnight I was able to leave my chamber.</p>
<p>One of my ﬁrst duties on my recovery was to</p>
<p>introduce Clerval to the several professors of the</p>
<p>university. In doing this, I underwent a kind of rough</p>
<p>usage, ill beﬁtting the wounds that my mind had</p>
<p>sustained. Ever since the fatal night, the end of my</p>
<p>labours, and the beginning of my misfortunes, I had</p>
<p>conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of</p>
<p>natural philosophy. When I was otherwise quite re-</p>
<p>stored to health, the sight of a chemical instrument</p>
<p>would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms.</p>
<p>Henry saw this, and had removed all my apparatus</p>
<p>from my view. He had also changed my apartment;</p>
<p>for he perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the</p>
<p>room which had previously been my laboratory. But</p>
<p>these cares of Clerval were made of no avail when I</p>
<p>visited the professors. M. Waldman inﬂicted torture</p>
<p>when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the</p>
<p>astonishing progress I had made in the sciences.</p>
<p>He soon perceived that I disliked the subject; but,</p>
<p>not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feel-</p>
<p>ings to modesty, and changed the subject from my</p>
<p>improvement to the science itself, with a desire, as</p>
<p>I evidently saw, of drawing me out. What could I</p>
<p>do? He meant to please, and he tormented me.</p>
<p>I felt as if he had placed carefully, one by one, in</p>
<p>my view those instruments which were to be after-</p>
<p>wards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death.</p>
<p>I writhed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the</p>
<p>pain I felt. Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were</p>
<p>always quick in discerning the sensations of others,</p>
<p>declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his total ig-</p>
<p>norance; and the conversation took a more general</p>
<p>turn. I thanked my friend from my heart, but I did</p>
<p>not speak. I saw plainly that he was surprised, but</p>
<p>he never attempted to draw my secret from me; and</p>
<p>although I loved him with a mixture of affection and</p>
<p>reverence that knew no bounds, yet I could never</p>
<p>persuade myself to conﬁde to him that event which</p>
<p>was so often present to my recollection, but which</p>
<p>I feared the detail to another would only impress</p>
<p>more deeply.</p>
<p>M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my</p>
<p>condition at that time, of almost insupportable sen-</p>
<p>sitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me</p>
<p>even more pain than the benevolent approbation</p>
<p>of M. Waldman. “D—n the fellow!” cried he; “why,</p>
<p>M. Clerval, I assure you he has outstript us all. Aye,</p>
<p>stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true. A</p>
<p>youngster who, but a few years ago, believed Cor-</p>
<p>nelius Agrippa as ﬁrmly as the gospel, has now set</p>
<p>himself at the head of the university; and if he is</p>
<p>not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of coun-</p>
<p>tenance. — Aye, aye,” continued he, observing my</p>
<p>face expressive of suffering, “M. Frankenstein is</p>
<p>modest; an excellent quality in a young man. Young</p>
<p>men should be difﬁdent of themselves, you know,</p>
<p>M. Clerval; I was myself when young: but that wears</p>
<p>out in a very short time.”</p>
<p>M. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on</p>
<p>himself, which happily turned the conversation from</p>
<p>a subject that was so annoying to me.</p>
<p>Clerval was no natural philosopher. His imag-</p>
<p>ination was too vivid for the minutiæ of science.</p>
<p>Languages were his principal study; and he sought,</p>
<p>by acquiring their elements, to open a ﬁeld for self-</p>
<p>instruction on his return to Geneva. Persian, Ara-</p>
<p>bic, and Hebrew, gained his attention, after he had</p>
<p>made himself perfectly master of Greek and Latin.</p>
<p>For my own part, idleness had ever been irksome</p>
<p>to me; and now that I wished to ﬂy from reﬂection,</p>
<p>and hated my former studies, I felt great relief in</p>
<p>being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not</p>
<p>only instruction but consolation in the works of the</p>
<p>orientalists. Their melancholy is soothing, and their</p>
<p>joy elevating to a degree I never experienced in</p>
<p>studying the authors of any other country. When</p>
<p>you read their writings, life appears to consist in a</p>
<p>warm sun and garden of roses, — in the smiles and</p>
<p>frowns of a fair enemy, and the ﬁre that consumes</p>
<p>your own heart. How different from the manly and</p>
<p>heroical poetry of Greece and Rome.</p>
<p>Summer passed away in these occupations,</p>
<p>and my return to Geneva was ﬁxed for the latter</p>
<p>end of autumn; but being delayed by several ac-</p>
<p>cidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were</p>
<p>deemed impassable, and my journey was retarded</p>
<p>until the ensuing spring. I felt this delay very bitterly;</p>
<p>for I longed to see my native town, and my beloved</p>
<p>friends. My return had only been delayed so long</p>
<p>from an unwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange</p>
<p>place, before he had become acquainted with any</p>
<p>of its inhabitants. The winter, however, was spent</p>
<p>cheerfully; and although the spring was uncom-</p>
<p>monly late, when it came, its beauty compensated</p>
<p>for its dilatoriness.</p>
<p>The month of May had already commenced,</p>
<p>and I expected the letter daily which was to ﬁx</p>
<p>the date of my departure, when Henry proposed a</p>
<p>pedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt that I</p>
<p>might bid a personal farewell to the country I had</p>
<p>so long inhabited. I acceded with pleasure to this</p>
<p>proposition: I was fond of exercise, and Clerval had</p>
<p>always been my favourite companion in the rambles</p>
<p>of this nature that I had taken among the scenes of</p>
<p>my native country.</p>
<p>We passed a fortnight in these perambulations:</p>
<p>my health and spirits had long been restored, and</p>
<p>they gained additional strength from the salubrious</p>
<p>air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress,</p>
<p>and the conversation of my friend. Study had be-</p>
<p>fore secluded me from the intercourse of my fellow-</p>
<p>creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but Clerval</p>
<p>called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again</p>
<p>taught me to love the aspect of nature, and the</p>
<p>cheerful faces of children. Excellent friend! how</p>
<p>sincerely did you love me, and endeavour to elevate</p>
<p>my mind, until it was on a level with your own. A</p>
<p>selﬁsh pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until</p>
<p>your gentleness and affection warmed and opened</p>
<p>my senses; I became the same happy creature who,</p>
<p>a few years ago, loving and beloved by all, had no</p>
<p>sorrow or care. When happy, inanimate nature had</p>
<p>the power of bestowing on me the most delightful</p>
<p>sensations. A serene sky and verdant ﬁelds ﬁlled</p>
<p>me with ecstacy. The present season was indeed</p>
<p>divine; the ﬂowers of spring bloomed in the hedges,</p>
<p>while those of summer were already in bud: I was</p>
<p>undisturbed by thoughts which during the preced-</p>
<p>ing year had pressed upon me, notwithstanding my</p>
<p>endeavours to throw them off, with an invincible</p>
<p>burden.</p>
<p>Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sym-</p>
<p>pathized in my feelings: he exerted himself to</p>
<p>amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that</p>
<p>ﬁlled his soul. The resources of his mind on this</p>
<p>occasion were truly astonishing: his conversation</p>
<p>was full of imagination; and very often, in imitation</p>
<p>of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales</p>
<p>of wonderful fancy and passion. At other times</p>
<p>he repeated my favourite poems, or drew me out</p>
<p>into arguments, which he supported with great</p>
<p>ingenuity.</p>
<p>We returned to our college on a Sunday after-</p>
<p>noon: the peasants were dancing, and every one</p>
<p>we met appeared gay and happy. My own spirits</p>
<p>were high, and I bounded along with feelings of</p>
<p>unbridled joy and hilarity.</p>
<p>Chapter VI</p>
<p>ON my return, I found the following letter from my</p>
<p>father:</p>
<p>“To V. FRANKENSTEIN.</p>
<p>“MY DEAR VICTOR,</p>
<p>“You have probably waited impatiently for a let-</p>
<p>ter to ﬁx the date of your return to us; and I was</p>
<p>at ﬁrst tempted to write only a few lines, merely</p>
<p>mentioning the day on which I should expect you.</p>
<p>But that would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not</p>
<p>do it. What would be your surprise, my son, when</p>
<p>107</p>
<p>you expected a happy and gay welcome, to behold,</p>
<p>on the contrary, tears and wretchedness? And how,</p>
<p>Victor, can I relate our misfortune? Absence cannot</p>
<p>have rendered you callous to our joys and griefs;</p>
<p>and how shall I inﬂict pain on an absent child? I</p>
<p>wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know</p>
<p>it is impossible; even now your eye skims over the</p>
<p>page, to seek the words which are to convey to you</p>
<p>the horrible tidings.</p>
<p>“William is dead! — that sweet child, whose</p>
<p>smiles delighted and warmed my heart, who was</p>
<p>so gentle, yet so gay! Victor, he is murdered!</p>
<p>“I will not attempt to console you; but will simply</p>
<p>relate the circumstances of the transaction.</p>
<p>“Last Thursday (May 7th) I, my niece, and your</p>
<p>two brothers, went to walk in Plainpalais. The</p>
<p>evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged</p>
<p>our walk farther than usual. It was already dusk</p>
<p>before we thought of returning; and then we dis-</p>
<p>covered that William and Ernest, who had gone on</p>
<p>before, were not to be found. We accordingly rested</p>
<p>on a seat until they should return. Presently Ernest</p>
<p>came, and inquired if we had seen his brother:</p>
<p>he said, that they had been playing together, that</p>
<p>William had run away to hide himself, and that he</p>
<p>vainly sought for him, and afterwards waited for him</p>
<p>a long time, but that he did not return.</p>
<p>“This account rather alarmed us, and we con-</p>
<p>tinued to search for him until night fell, when Eliza-</p>
<p>beth conjectured that he might have returned to the</p>
<p>house. He was not there. We returned again, with</p>
<p>torches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my</p>
<p>sweet boy had lost himself, and was exposed to all</p>
<p>the damps and dews of night: Elizabeth also suf-</p>
<p>fered extreme anguish. About ﬁve in the morning I</p>
<p>discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I</p>
<p>had seen blooming and active in health, stretched</p>
<p>on the grass livid and motionless: the print of the</p>
<p>murderer’s ﬁnger was on his neck.</p>
<p>“He was conveyed home, and the anguish that</p>
<p>was visible in my countenance betrayed the secret</p>
<p>to Elizabeth. She was very earnest to see the</p>
<p>corpse. At ﬁrst I attempted to prevent her; but she</p>
<p>persisted, and entering the room where it lay, hastily</p>
<p>examined the neck of the victim, and clasping her</p>
<p>hands exclaimed, ‘O God! I have murdered my</p>
<p>darling infant!’</p>
<p>“She fainted, and was restored with extreme</p>
<p>difﬁculty. When she again lived, it was only to weep</p>
<p>and sigh. She told me, that that same evening</p>
<p>William had teazed her to let him wear a very valu-</p>
<p>able miniature that she possessed of your mother.</p>
<p>This picture is gone, and was doubtless the temp-</p>
<p>tation which urged the murderer to the deed. We</p>
<p>have no trace of him at present, although our exer-</p>
<p>tions to discover him are unremitted; but they will</p>
<p>not restore my beloved William.</p>
<p>“Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console</p>
<p>Elizabeth. She weeps continually, and accuses</p>
<p>herself unjustly as the cause of his death; her words</p>
<p>pierce my heart. We are all unhappy; but will not</p>
<p>that be an additional motive for you, my son, to</p>
<p>return and be our comforter? Your dear mother!</p>
<p>Alas, Victor! I now say, Thank God she did not</p>
<p>live to witness the cruel, miserable death of her</p>
<p>youngest darling!</p>
<p>“Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts of veng-</p>
<p>eance against the assassin, but with feelings of</p>
<p>peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of fes-</p>
<p>tering the wounds of our minds. Enter the house of</p>
<p>mourning, my friend, but with kindness and affec-</p>
<p>tion for those who love you, and not with hatred for</p>
<p>your enemies.</p>
<p>“Your affectionate and afﬂicted father,</p>
<p>“ALPHONSE FRANKENSTEIN.</p>
<p>“Geneva, May 12th, 17—.”</p>
<p>Clerval, who had watched my countenance as</p>
<p>I read this letter, was surprised to observe the de-</p>
<p>spair that succeeded to the joy I at ﬁrst expressed</p>
<p>on receiving news from my friends. I threw the letter</p>
<p>on the table, and covered my face with my hands.</p>
<p>“My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed Henry, when</p>
<p>he perceived me weep with bitterness, “are you</p>
<p>always to be unhappy? My dear friend, what has</p>
<p>happened?”</p>
<p>I motioned to him to take up the letter, while I</p>
<p>walked up and down the room in the extremest agi-</p>
<p>tation. Tears also gushed from the eyes of Clerval,</p>
<p>as he read the account of my misfortune.</p>
<p>“I can offer you no consolation, my friend,” said</p>
<p>he; “your disaster is irreparable. What do you intend</p>
<p>to do?”</p>
<p>“To go instantly to Geneva: come with me,</p>
<p>Henry, to order the horses.”</p>
<p>During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to raise</p>
<p>my spirits. He did not do this by common topics of</p>
<p>consolation, but by exhibiting the truest sympathy.</p>
<p>“Poor William!” said he, “that dear child; he now</p>
<p>sleeps with his angel mother. His friends mourn</p>
<p>and weep, but he is at rest: he does not now feel</p>
<p>the murderer’s grasp; a sod covers his gentle form,</p>
<p>and he knows no pain. He can no longer be a</p>
<p>ﬁt subject for pity; the survivors are the greatest</p>
<p>sufferers, and for them time is the only consolation.</p>
<p>Those maxims of the Stoics, that death was no evil,</p>
<p>and that the mind of man ought to be superior to</p>
<p>despair on the eternal absence of a beloved object,</p>
<p>ought not to be urged. Even Cato wept over the</p>
<p>dead body of his brother.”</p>
<p>Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the</p>
<p>streets; the words impressed themselves on my</p>
<p>mind, and I remembered them afterwards in soli-</p>
<p>tude. But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I</p>
<p>hurried into a cabriole, and bade farewell to my</p>
<p>friend.</p>
<p>My journey was very melancholy. At ﬁrst I</p>
<p>wished to hurry on, for I longed to console and</p>
<p>sympathize with my loved and sorrowing friends;</p>
<p>but when I drew near my native town, I slackened</p>
<p>my progress. I could hardly sustain the multitude</p>
<p>of feelings that crowded into my mind. I passed</p>
<p>through scenes familiar to my youth, but which I</p>
<p>had not seen for nearly six years. How altered ev-</p>
<p>ery thing might be during that time? One sudden</p>
<p>and desolating change had taken place; but a thou-</p>
<p>sand little circumstances might have by degrees</p>
<p>worked other alterations which, although they were</p>
<p>done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive.</p>
<p>Fear overcame me; I dared not advance, dreading</p>
<p>a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble,</p>
<p>although I was unable to deﬁne them.</p>
<p>I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful</p>
<p>state of mind. I contemplated the lake: the wa-</p>
<p>ters were placid; all around was calm, and the</p>
<p>snowy mountains, “the palaces of nature,” were</p>
<p>not changed. By degrees the calm and heavenly</p>
<p>scene restored me, and I continued my journey</p>
<p>towards Geneva.</p>
<p>The road ran by the side of the lake, which</p>
<p>became narrower as I approached my native town.</p>
<p>I discovered more distinctly the black sides of Jura,</p>
<p>and the bright summit of Mont Blânc; I wept like a</p>
<p>child: “Dear mountains! my own beautiful lake! how</p>
<p>do you welcome your wanderer? Your summits</p>
<p>are clear; the sky and lake are blue and placid.</p>
<p>Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my</p>
<p>unhappiness?”</p>
<p>I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself</p>
<p>tedious by dwelling on these preliminary circum-</p>
<p>stances; but they were days of comparative happi-</p>
<p>ness, and I think of them with pleasure. My country,</p>
<p>my beloved country! who but a native can tell the</p>
<p>delight I took in again beholding thy streams, thy</p>
<p>mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely lake.</p>
<p>Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again</p>
<p>overcame me. Night also closed around; and when</p>
<p>I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still</p>
<p>more gloomily. The picture appeared a vast and</p>
<p>dim scene of evil, and I foresaw obscurely that I was</p>
<p>destined to become the most wretched of human</p>
<p>beings. Alas! I prophesied truly, and failed only</p>
<p>in one single circumstance, that in all the misery</p>
<p>I imagined and dreaded, I did not conceive the</p>
<p>hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to</p>
<p>endure.</p>
<p>It was completely dark when I arrived in the</p>
<p>environs of Geneva; the gates of the town were</p>
<p>already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night</p>
<p>at Secheron, a village half a league to the east</p>
<p>of the city. The sky was serene; and, as I was</p>
<p>unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot where</p>
<p>my poor William had been murdered. As I could</p>
<p>not pass through the town, I was obliged to cross</p>
<p>the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais. During</p>
<p>this short voyage I saw the lightnings playing on</p>
<p>the summit of Mont Blânc in the most beautiful</p>
<p>ﬁgures. The storm appeared to approach rapidly;</p>
<p>and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might</p>
<p>observe its progress. It advanced; the heavens</p>
<p>were clouded, and I soon felt the rain coming slowly</p>
<p>in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.</p>
<p>I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the</p>
<p>darkness and storm increased every minute, and</p>
<p>the thunder burst with a terriﬁc crash over my head.</p>
<p>It was echoed from Salêve, the Juras, and the Alps</p>
<p>of Savoy; vivid ﬂashes of lightning dazzled my eyes,</p>
<p>illuminating the lake, making it appear like a vast</p>
<p>sheet of ﬁre; then for an instant every thing seemed</p>
<p>of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself</p>
<p>from the preceding ﬂash. The storm, as is often the</p>
<p>case in Switzerland, appeared at once in various</p>
<p>parts of the heavens. The most violent storm hung</p>
<p>exactly north of the town, over that part of the lake</p>
<p>which lies between the promontory of Belrive and</p>
<p>the village of Copêt. Another storm enlightened</p>
<p>Jura with faint ﬂashes; and another darkened and</p>
<p>sometimes disclosed the Môle, a peaked mountain</p>
<p>to the east of the lake.</p>
<p>While I watched the storm, so beautiful yet ter-</p>
<p>riﬁc, I wandered on with a hasty step. This noble</p>
<p>war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my</p>
<p>hands, and exclaimed aloud, “William, dear angel!</p>
<p>this is thy funeral, this thy dirge!” As I said these</p>
<p>words, I perceived in the gloom a ﬁgure which stole</p>
<p>from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood ﬁxed,</p>
<p>gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A ﬂash</p>
<p>of lightning illuminated the object, and discovered</p>
<p>its shape plainly to me; its gigantic stature, and the</p>
<p>deformity of its aspect, more hideous than belongs</p>
<p>to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the</p>
<p>wretch, the ﬁlthy dæmon to whom I had given life.</p>
<p>What did he there? Could he be (I shuddered at the</p>
<p>conception) the murderer of my brother? No sooner</p>
<p>did that idea cross my imagination, than I became</p>
<p>convinced of its truth; my teeth chattered, and I</p>
<p>was forced to lean against a tree for support. The</p>
<p>ﬁgure passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom.</p>
<p>Nothing in human shape could have destroyed that</p>
<p>fair child. He was the murderer! I could not doubt it.</p>
<p>The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible</p>
<p>proof of the fact. I thought of pursuing the devil;</p>
<p>but it would have been in vain, for another ﬂash</p>
<p>discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of</p>
<p>the nearly perpendicular ascent of Mont Salêve, a</p>
<p>hill that bounds Plainpalais on the south. He soon</p>
<p>reached the summit, and disappeared.</p>
<p>I remained motionless. The thunder ceased;</p>
<p>but the rain still continued, and the scene was en-</p>
<p>veloped in an impenetrable darkness. I revolved in</p>
<p>my mind the events which I had until now sought</p>
<p>to forget: the whole train of my progress towards</p>
<p>the creation; the appearance of the work of my own</p>
<p>hands alive at my bed side; its departure. Two years</p>
<p>had now nearly elapsed since the night on which</p>
<p>he ﬁrst received life; and was this his ﬁrst crime?</p>
<p>Alas! I had turned loose into the world a depraved</p>
<p>wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery;</p>
<p>had he not murdered my brother?</p>
<p>No one can conceive the anguish I suffered</p>
<p>during the remainder of the night, which I spent,</p>
<p>cold and wet, in the open air. But I did not feel the</p>
<p>inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was</p>
<p>busy in scenes of evil and despair. I considered</p>
<p>the being whom I had cast among mankind, and</p>
<p>endowed with the will and power to effect purposes</p>
<p>of horror, such as the deed which he had now done,</p>
<p>nearly in the light of my own vampire, my own spirit</p>
<p>let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all</p>
<p>that was dear to me.</p>
<p>Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards</p>
<p>the town. The gates were open; and I hastened to</p>
<p>my father’s house. My ﬁrst thought was to discover</p>
<p>what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pur-</p>
<p>suit to be made. But I paused when I reﬂected on</p>
<p>the story that I had to tell. A being whom I myself</p>
<p>had formed, and endued with life, had met me at</p>
<p>midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible</p>
<p>mountain. I remembered also the nervous fever</p>
<p>with which I had been seized just at the time that</p>
<p>I dated my creation, and which would give an air</p>
<p>of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improba-</p>
<p>ble. I well knew that if any other had communicated</p>
<p>such a relation to me, I should have looked upon</p>
<p>it as the ravings of insanity. Besides, the strange</p>
<p>nature of the animal would elude all pursuit, even</p>
<p>if I were so far credited as to persuade my rela-</p>
<p>tives to commence it. Besides, of what use would</p>
<p>be pursuit? Who could arrest a creature capable</p>
<p>of scaling the overhanging sides of Mont Salêve?</p>
<p>These reﬂections determined me, and I resolved to</p>
<p>remain silent.</p>
<p>It was about ﬁve in the morning when I entered</p>
<p>my father’s house. I told the servants not to disturb</p>
<p>the family, and went into the library to attend their</p>
<p>usual hour of rising.</p>
<p>Six years had elapsed, passed as a dream but</p>
<p>for one indelible trace, and I stood in the same place</p>
<p>where I had last embraced my father before my</p>
<p>departure for Ingolstadt. Beloved and respectable</p>
<p>parent! He still remained to me. I gazed on the</p>
<p>picture of my mother, which stood over the mantle-</p>
<p>piece. It was an historical subject, painted at my</p>
<p>father’s desire, and represented Caroline Beaufort</p>
<p>in an agony of despair, kneeling by the cofﬁn of her</p>
<p>dead father. Her garb was rustic, and her cheek</p>
<p>pale; but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that</p>
<p>hardly permitted the sentiment of pity. Below this</p>
<p>picture was a miniature of William; and my tears</p>
<p>ﬂowed when I looked upon it. While I was thus</p>
<p>engaged, Ernest entered: he had heard me arrive,</p>
<p>and hastened to welcome me. He expressed a</p>
<p>sorrowful delight to see me: “Welcome, my dearest</p>
<p>Victor,” said he. “Ah! I wish you had come three</p>
<p>months ago, and then you would have found us all</p>
<p>joyous and delighted. But we are now unhappy;</p>
<p>and, I am afraid, tears instead of smiles will be</p>
<p>your welcome. Our father looks so sorrowful: this</p>
<p>dreadful event seems to have revived in his mind</p>
<p>his grief on the death of Mamma. Poor Elizabeth</p>
<p>also is quite inconsolable.” Ernest began to weep</p>
<p>as he said these words.</p>
<p>“Do not,” said I, “welcome me thus; try to be</p>
<p>more calm, that I may not be absolutely miserable</p>
<p>the moment I enter my father’s house after so long</p>
<p>an absence. But, tell me, how does my father sup-</p>
<p>port his misfortunes? and how is my poor Eliza-</p>
<p>beth?”</p>
<p>“She indeed requires consolation; she accused</p>
<p>herself of having caused the death of my brother,</p>
<p>and that made her very wretched. But since the</p>
<p>murderer has been discovered —— ”</p>
<p>“The murderer discovered! Good God! how can</p>
<p>that be? who could attempt to pursue him? It is</p>
<p>impossible; one might as well try to overtake the</p>
<p>winds, or conﬁne a mountain-stream with a straw.”</p>
<p>“I do not know what you mean; but we were all</p>
<p>very unhappy when she was discovered. No one</p>
<p>would believe it at ﬁrst; and even now Elizabeth will</p>
<p>not be convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence.</p>
<p>Indeed, who would credit that Justine Moritz, who</p>
<p>was so amiable, and fond of all the family, could all</p>
<p>at once become so extremely wicked?”</p>
<p>“Justine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the ac-</p>
<p>cused? But it is wrongfully; every one knows that;</p>
<p>no one believes it, surely, Ernest?”</p>
<p>“No one did at ﬁrst; but several circumstances</p>
<p>came out, that have almost forced conviction upon</p>
<p>us: and her own behaviour has been so confused,</p>
<p>as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I</p>
<p>fear, leaves no hope for doubt. But she will be tried</p>
<p>to-day, and you will then hear all.”</p>
<p>He related that, the morning on which the mur-</p>
<p>der of poor William had been discovered, Justine</p>
<p>had been taken ill, and conﬁned to her bed; and,</p>
<p>after several days, one of the servants, happen-</p>
<p>ing to examine the apparel she had worn on the</p>
<p>night of the murder, had discovered in her pocket</p>
<p>the picture of my mother, which had been judged</p>
<p>to be the temptation of the murderer. The servant</p>
<p>instantly shewed it to one of the others, who, with-</p>
<p>out saying a word to any of the family, went to a</p>
<p>magistrate; and, upon their deposition, Justine was</p>
<p>apprehended. On being charged with the fact, the</p>
<p>poor girl conﬁrmed the suspicion in a great measure</p>
<p>by her extreme confusion of manner.</p>
<p>This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my</p>
<p>faith; and I replied earnestly, “You are all mistaken;</p>
<p>I know the murderer. Justine, poor, good Justine, is</p>
<p>innocent.”</p>
<p>At that instant my father entered. I saw unhappi-</p>
<p>ness deeply impressed on his countenance, but he</p>
<p>endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and, after</p>
<p>we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would</p>
<p>have introduced some other topic than that of our</p>
<p>disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed, “Good God,</p>
<p>Papa! Victor says that he knows who was the mur-</p>
<p>derer of poor William.”</p>
<p>“We do also, unfortunately,” replied my father;</p>
<p>“for indeed I had rather have been for ever igno-</p>
<p>rant than have discovered so much depravity and</p>
<p>ingratitude in one I valued so highly.”</p>
<p>“My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is</p>
<p>innocent.”</p>
<p>“If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as</p>
<p>guilty. She is to be tried to-day, and I hope, I sin-</p>
<p>cerely hope, that she will be acquitted.”</p>
<p>This speech calmed me. I was ﬁrmly convinced</p>
<p>in my own mind that Justine, and indeed every</p>
<p>human being, was guiltless of this murder. I had</p>
<p>no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence</p>
<p>could be brought forward strong enough to con-</p>
<p>vict her; and, in this assurance, I calmed myself,</p>
<p>expecting the trial with eagerness, but without prog-</p>
<p>nosticating an evil result.</p>
<p>We were soon joined by Elizabeth. Time had</p>
<p>made great alterations in her form since I had last</p>
<p>beheld her. Six years before she had been a pretty,</p>
<p>good-humoured girl, whom every one loved and</p>
<p>caressed. She was now a woman in stature and ex-</p>
<p>pression of countenance, which was uncommonly</p>
<p>lovely. An open and capacious forehead gave in-</p>
<p>dications of a good understanding, joined to great</p>
<p>frankness of disposition. Her eyes were hazel, and</p>
<p>expressive of mildness, now through recent afﬂic-</p>
<p>tion allied to sadness. Her hair was of a rich, dark</p>
<p>auburn, her complexion fair, and her ﬁgure slight</p>
<p>and graceful. She welcomed me with the great-</p>
<p>est affection. “Your arrival, my dear cousin,” said</p>
<p>she, “ﬁlls me with hope. You perhaps will ﬁnd some</p>
<p>means to justify my poor guiltless Justine. Alas!</p>
<p>who is safe, if she be convicted of crime? I rely on</p>
<p>her innocence as certainly as I do upon my own.</p>
<p>Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not</p>
<p>only lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl,</p>
<p>whom I sincerely love, is to be torn away by even a</p>
<p>worse fate. If she is condemned, I never shall know</p>
<p>joy more. But she will not, I am sure she will not;</p>
<p>and then I shall be happy again, even after the sad</p>
<p>death of my little William.”</p>
<p>“She is innocent, my Elizabeth,” said I, “and that</p>
<p>shall be proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be</p>
<p>cheered by the assurance of her acquittal.”</p>
<p>“How kind you are! every one else believes in</p>
<p>her guilt, and that made me wretched; for I knew</p>
<p>that it was impossible: and to see every one else</p>
<p>prejudiced in so deadly a manner, rendered me</p>
<p>hopeless and despairing.” She wept.</p>
<p>“Sweet niece,” said my father, “dry your tears. If</p>
<p>she is, as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice</p>
<p>of our judges, and the activity with which I shall</p>
<p>prevent the slightest shadow of partiality.”</p>
<p>Chapter VII</p>
<p>WE passed a few sad hours, until eleven o’clock,</p>
<p>when the trial was to commence. My father and</p>
<p>the rest of the family being obliged to attend as wit-</p>
<p>nesses, I accompanied them to the court. During</p>
<p>the whole of this wretched mockery of justice, I suf-</p>
<p>fered living torture. It was to be decided, whether</p>
<p>the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would</p>
<p>cause the death of two of my fellow-beings: one a</p>
<p>smiling babe, full of innocence and joy; the other far</p>
<p>more dreadfully murdered, with every aggravation</p>
<p>of infamy that could make the murder memorable</p>
<p>127</p>
<p>in horror. Justine also was a girl of merit, and pos-</p>
<p>sessed qualities which promised to render her life</p>
<p>happy: now all was to be obliterated in an igno-</p>
<p>minious grave; and I the cause! A thousand times</p>
<p>rather would I have confessed myself guilty of the</p>
<p>crime ascribed to Justine; but I was absent when</p>
<p>it was committed, and such a declaration would</p>
<p>have been considered as the ravings of a madman,</p>
<p>and would not have exculpated her who suffered</p>
<p>through me.</p>
<p>The appearance of Justine was calm. She was</p>
<p>dressed in mourning; and her countenance, always</p>
<p>engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her</p>
<p>feelings, exquisitely beautiful. Yet she appeared</p>
<p>conﬁdent in innocence, and did not tremble, al-</p>
<p>though gazed on and execrated by thousands; for</p>
<p>all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise</p>
<p>have excited, was obliterated in the minds of the</p>
<p>spectators by the imagination of the enormity she</p>
<p>was supposed to have committed. She was tranquil,</p>
<p>yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and</p>
<p>as her confusion had before been adduced as a</p>
<p>proof of her guilt, she worked up her mind to an ap-</p>
<p>pearance of courage. When she entered the court,</p>
<p>she threw her eyes round it, and quickly discovered</p>
<p>where we were seated. A tear seemed to dim her</p>
<p>eye when she saw us; but she quickly recovered</p>
<p>herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to</p>
<p>attest her utter guiltlessness.</p>
<p>The trial began; and after the advocate against</p>
<p>her had stated the charge, several witnesses were</p>
<p>called. Several strange facts combined against her,</p>
<p>which might have staggered any one who had not</p>
<p>such proof of her innocence as I had. She had been</p>
<p>out the whole of the night on which the murder had</p>
<p>been committed, and towards morning had been</p>
<p>perceived by a market-woman not far from the spot</p>
<p>where the body of the murdered child had been</p>
<p>afterwards found. The woman asked her what she</p>
<p>did there; but she looked very strangely, and only</p>
<p>returned a confused and unintelligible answer. She</p>
<p>returned to the house about eight o’clock; and when</p>
<p>one inquired where she had passed the night, she</p>
<p>replied, that she had been looking for the child, and</p>
<p>demanded earnestly, if any thing had been heard</p>
<p>concerning him. When shewn the body, she fell into</p>
<p>violent hysterics, and kept her bed for several days.</p>
<p>The picture was then produced, which the servant</p>
<p>had found in her pocket; and when Elizabeth, in a</p>
<p>faltering voice, proved that it was the same which,</p>
<p>an hour before the child had been missed, she had</p>
<p>placed round his neck, a murmur of horror and</p>
<p>indignation ﬁlled the court.</p>
<p>Justine was called on for her defence. As the</p>
<p>trial had proceeded, her countenance had altered.</p>
<p>Surprise, horror, and misery, were strongly ex-</p>
<p>pressed. Sometimes she struggled with her tears;</p>
<p>but when she was desired to plead, she collected</p>
<p>her powers, and spoke in an audible although</p>
<p>variable voice:—</p>
<p>“God knows,” she said, “how entirely I am in-</p>
<p>nocent. But I do not pretend that my protestations</p>
<p>should acquit me: I rest my innocence on a plain</p>
<p>and simple explanation of the facts which have</p>
<p>been adduced against me; and I hope the char-</p>
<p>acter I have always borne will incline my judges to a</p>
<p>favourable interpretation, where any circumstance</p>
<p>appears doubtful or suspicious.”</p>
<p>She then related that, by the permission of Eliz-</p>
<p>abeth, she had passed the evening of the night on</p>
<p>which the murder had been committed, at the house</p>
<p>of an aunt at Chêne, a village situated at about a</p>
<p>league from Geneva. On her return, at about nine</p>
<p>o’clock, she met a man, who asked her if she had</p>
<p>seen any thing of the child who was lost. She was</p>
<p>alarmed by this account, and passed several hours</p>
<p>in looking for him, when the gates of Geneva were</p>
<p>shut, and she was forced to remain several hours</p>
<p>of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being</p>
<p>unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she</p>
<p>was well known. Unable to rest or sleep, she quitted</p>
<p>her asylum early, that she might again endeavour</p>
<p>to ﬁnd my brother. If she had gone near the spot</p>
<p>where his body lay, it was without her knowledge.</p>
<p>That she had been bewildered when questioned by</p>
<p>the market-woman, was not surprising, since she</p>
<p>had passed a sleepless night, and the fate of poor</p>
<p>William was yet uncertain. Concerning the picture</p>
<p>she could give no account.</p>
<p>“I know,” continued the unhappy victim, “how</p>
<p>heavily and fatally this one circumstance weighs</p>
<p>against me, but I have no power of explaining it; and</p>
<p>when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am</p>
<p>only left to conjecture concerning the probabilities</p>
<p>by which it might have been placed in my pocket.</p>
<p>But here also I am checked. I believe that I have</p>
<p>no enemy on earth, and none surely would have</p>
<p>been so wicked as to destroy me wantonly. Did the</p>
<p>murderer place it there? I know of no opportunity</p>
<p>afforded him for so doing; or if I had, why should he</p>
<p>have stolen the jewel, to part with it again so soon?</p>
<p>“I commit my cause to the justice of my judges,</p>
<p>yet I see no room for hope. I beg permission to have</p>
<p>a few witnesses examined concerning my charac-</p>
<p>ter; and if their testimony shall not overweigh my</p>
<p>supposed guilt, I must be condemned, although I</p>
<p>would pledge my salvation on my innocence.”</p>
<p>Several witnesses were called, who had known</p>
<p>her for many years, and they spoke well of her; but</p>
<p>fear, and hatred of the crime of which they sup-</p>
<p>posed her guilty, rendered them timorous, and un-</p>
<p>willing to come forward. Elizabeth saw even this last</p>
<p>resource, her excellent dispositions and irreproach-</p>
<p>able conduct, about to fail the accused, when, al-</p>
<p>though violently agitated, she desired permission</p>
<p>to address the court.</p>
<p>“I am,” said she, “the cousin of the unhappy</p>
<p>child who was murdered, or rather his sister, for I</p>
<p>was educated by and have lived with his parents</p>
<p>ever since and even long before his birth. It may</p>
<p>therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward</p>
<p>on this occasion; but when I see a fellow-creature</p>
<p>about to perish through the cowardice of her pre-</p>
<p>tended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I</p>
<p>may say what I know of her character. I am well ac-</p>
<p>quainted with the accused. I have lived in the same</p>
<p>house with her, at one time for ﬁve, and at another</p>
<p>for nearly two years. During all that period she ap-</p>
<p>peared to me the most amiable and benevolent of</p>
<p>human creatures. She nursed Madame Franken-</p>
<p>stein, my aunt, in her last illness with the greatest af-</p>
<p>fection and care; and afterwards attended her own</p>
<p>mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that</p>
<p>excited the admiration of all who knew her. After</p>
<p>which she again lived in my uncle’s house, where</p>
<p>she was beloved by all the family. She was warmly</p>
<p>attached to the child who is now dead, and acted</p>
<p>towards him like a most affectionate mother. For</p>
<p>my own part, I do not hesitate to say, that, notwith-</p>
<p>standing all the evidence produced against her, I</p>
<p>believe and rely on her perfect innocence. She had</p>
<p>no temptation for such an action: as to the bauble</p>
<p>on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly</p>
<p>desired it, I should have willingly given it to her; so</p>
<p>much do I esteem and value her.”</p>
<p>Excellent Elizabeth! A murmur of approbation</p>
<p>was heard; but it was excited by her generous inter-</p>
<p>ference, and not in favour of poor Justine, on whom</p>
<p>the public indignation was turned with renewed vi-</p>
<p>olence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude.</p>
<p>She herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did</p>
<p>not answer. My own agitation and anguish was</p>
<p>extreme during the whole trial. I believed in her</p>
<p>innocence; I knew it. Could the dæmon, who had</p>
<p>(I did not for a minute doubt) murdered my brother,</p>
<p>also in his hellish sport have betrayed the innocent</p>
<p>to death and ignominy. I could not sustain the horror</p>
<p>of my situation; and when I perceived that the popu-</p>
<p>lar voice, and the countenances of the judges, had</p>
<p>already condemned my unhappy victim, I rushed</p>
<p>out of the court in agony. The tortures of the ac-</p>
<p>cused did not equal mine; she was sustained by</p>
<p>innocence, but the fangs of remorse tore my bosom,</p>
<p>and would not forego their hold.</p>
<p>I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. In</p>
<p>the morning I went to the court; my lips and throat</p>
<p>were parched. I dared not ask the fatal question;</p>
<p>but I was known, and the ofﬁcer guessed the cause</p>
<p>of my visit. The ballots had been thrown; they were</p>
<p>all black, and Justine was condemned.</p>
<p>I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. I</p>
<p>had before experienced sensations of horror; and I</p>
<p>have endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate</p>
<p>expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of</p>
<p>the heart-sickening despair that I then endured.</p>
<p>The person to whom I addressed myself added,</p>
<p>that Justine had already confessed her guilt. “That</p>
<p>evidence,” he observed, “was hardly required in so</p>
<p>glaring a case, but I am glad of it; and, indeed,</p>
<p>none of our judges like to condemn a criminal upon</p>
<p>circumstantial evidence, be it ever so decisive.”</p>
<p>When I returned home, Elizabeth eagerly de-</p>
<p>manded the result.</p>
<p>“My cousin,” replied I, “it is decided as you may</p>
<p>have expected; all judges had rather that ten in-</p>
<p>nocent should suffer, than that one guilty should</p>
<p>escape. But she has confessed.”</p>
<p>This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who</p>
<p>had relied with ﬁrmness upon Justine’s innocence.</p>
<p>“Alas!” said she, “how shall I ever again believe in</p>
<p>human benevolence? Justine, whom I loved and</p>
<p>esteemed as my sister, how could she put on those</p>
<p>smiles of innocence only to betray; her mild eyes</p>
<p>seemed incapable of any severity or ill-humour, and</p>
<p>yet she has committed a murder.”</p>
<p>Soon after we heard that the poor victim had</p>
<p>expressed a wish to see my cousin. My father</p>
<p>wished her not to go; but said, that he left it to her</p>
<p>own judgment and feelings to decide. “Yes,” said</p>
<p>Elizabeth, “I will go, although she is guilty; and you,</p>
<p>Victor, shall accompany me: I cannot go alone.”</p>
<p>The idea of this visit was torture to me, yet I could</p>
<p>not refuse.</p>
<p>We entered the gloomy prison-chamber, and</p>
<p>beheld Justine sitting on some straw at the fur-</p>
<p>ther end; her hands were manacled, and her head</p>
<p>rested on her knees. She rose on seeing us enter;</p>
<p>and when we were left alone with her, she threw</p>
<p>herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly. My</p>
<p>cousin wept also.</p>
<p>“Oh, Justine!” said she, “why did you rob me</p>
<p>of my last consolation. I relied on your innocence;</p>
<p>and although I was then very wretched, I was not</p>
<p>so miserable as I am now.”</p>
<p>“And do you also believe that I am so very, very</p>
<p>wicked? Do you also join with my enemies to crush</p>
<p>me?” Her voice was suffocated with sobs.</p>
<p>“Rise, my poor girl,” said Elizabeth, “why do you</p>
<p>kneel, if you are innocent? I am not one of your</p>
<p>enemies; I believed you guiltless, notwithstanding</p>
<p>every evidence, until I heard that you had your-</p>
<p>self declared your guilt. That report, you say, is</p>
<p>false; and be assured, dear Justine, that nothing</p>
<p>can shake my conﬁdence in you for a moment, but</p>
<p>your own confession.”</p>
<p>“I did confess; but I confessed a lie. I confessed,</p>
<p>that I might obtain absolution; but now that false-</p>
<p>hood lies heavier at my heart than all my other sins.</p>
<p>The God of heaven forgive me! Ever since I was</p>
<p>condemned, my confessor has besieged me; he</p>
<p>threatened and menaced, until I almost began to</p>
<p>think that I was the monster that he said I was. He</p>
<p>threatened excommunication and hell ﬁre in my last</p>
<p>moments, if I continued obdurate. Dear lady, I had</p>
<p>none to support me; all looked on me as a wretch</p>
<p>doomed to ignominy and perdition. What could I</p>
<p>do? In an evil hour I subscribed to a lie; and now</p>
<p>only am I truly miserable.”</p>
<p>She paused, weeping, and then continued — “I</p>
<p>thought with horror, my sweet lady, that you should</p>
<p>believe your Justine, whom your blessed aunt had</p>
<p>so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a</p>
<p>creature capable of a crime which none but the</p>
<p>devil himself could have perpetrated. Dear William!</p>
<p>dearest blessed child! I soon shall see you again</p>
<p>in heaven, where we shall all be happy; and that</p>
<p>consoles me, going as I am to suffer ignominy and</p>
<p>death.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Justine! forgive me for having for one mo-</p>
<p>ment distrusted you. Why did you confess? But do</p>
<p>not mourn, my dear girl; I will every where proclaim</p>
<p>your innocence, and force belief. Yet you must die;</p>
<p>you, my playfellow, my companion, my more than</p>
<p>sister. I never can survive so horrible a misfortune.”</p>
<p>“Dear, sweet Elizabeth, do not weep. You ought</p>
<p>to raise me with thoughts of a better life, and elevate</p>
<p>me from the petty cares of this world of injustice</p>
<p>and strife. Do not you, excellent friend, drive me to</p>
<p>despair.”</p>
<p>“I will try to comfort you; but this, I fear, is an evil</p>
<p>too deep and poignant to admit of consolation, for</p>
<p>there is no hope. Yet heaven bless thee, my dearest</p>
<p>Justine, with resignation, and a conﬁdence elevated</p>
<p>beyond this world. Oh! how I hate its shews and</p>
<p>mockeries! when one creature is murdered, another</p>
<p>is immediately deprived of life in a slow torturing</p>
<p>manner; then the executioners, their hands yet reek-</p>
<p>ing with the blood of innocence, believe that they</p>
<p>have done a great deed. They call this retribution.</p>
<p>Hateful name! When that word is pronounced, I</p>
<p>know greater and more horrid punishments are go-</p>
<p>ing to be inﬂicted than the gloomiest tyrant has ever</p>
<p>invented to satiate his utmost revenge. Yet this is</p>
<p>not consolation for you, my Justine, unless indeed</p>
<p>that you may glory in escaping from so miserable</p>
<p>a den. Alas! I would I were in peace with my aunt</p>
<p>and my lovely William, escaped from a world which</p>
<p>is hateful to me, and the visages of men which I</p>
<p>abhor.”</p>
<p>Justine smiled languidly. “This, dear lady, is</p>
<p>despair, and not resignation. I must not learn the</p>
<p>lesson that you would teach me. Talk of something</p>
<p>else, something that will bring peace, and not in-</p>
<p>crease of misery.”</p>
<p>During this conversation I had retired to a corner</p>
<p>of the prison-room, where I could conceal the horrid</p>
<p>anguish that possessed me. Despair! Who dared</p>
<p>talk of that? The poor victim, who on the morrow</p>
<p>was to pass the dreary boundary between life and</p>
<p>death, felt not as I did, such deep and bitter agony.</p>
<p>I gnashed my teeth, and ground them together,</p>
<p>uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul.</p>
<p>Justine started. When she saw who it was, she</p>
<p>approached me, and said, “Dear Sir, you are very</p>
<p>kind to visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I</p>
<p>am guilty.”</p>
<p>I could not answer. “No, Justine,” said Elizabeth;</p>
<p>“he is more convinced of your innocence than I was;</p>
<p>for even when he heard that you had confessed, he</p>
<p>did not credit it.”</p>
<p>“I truly thank him. In these last moments I feel</p>
<p>the sincerest gratitude towards those who think of</p>
<p>me with kindness. How sweet is the affection of</p>
<p>others to such a wretch as I am! It removes more</p>
<p>than half my misfortune; and I feel as if I could die</p>
<p>in peace, now that my innocence is acknowledged</p>
<p>by you, dear lady, and your cousin.”</p>
<p>Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others</p>
<p>and herself. She indeed gained the resignation she</p>
<p>desired. But I, the true murderer, felt the never-</p>
<p>dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of</p>
<p>no hope or consolation. Elizabeth also wept, and</p>
<p>was unhappy; but her’s also was the misery of in-</p>
<p>nocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the</p>
<p>fair moon, for a while hides, but cannot tarnish its</p>
<p>brightness. Anguish and despair had penetrated</p>
<p>into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within me,</p>
<p>which nothing could extinguish. We staid several</p>
<p>hours with Justine; and it was with great difﬁculty</p>
<p>that Elizabeth could tear herself away. “I wish,” cried</p>
<p>she, “that I were to die with you; I cannot live in this</p>
<p>world of misery.”</p>
<p>Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while</p>
<p>she with difﬁculty repressed her bitter tears. She</p>
<p>embraced Elizabeth, and said, in a voice of half-</p>
<p>suppressed emotion, “Farewell, sweet lady, dearest</p>
<p>Elizabeth, my beloved and only friend; may heaven</p>
<p>in its bounty bless and preserve you; may this be</p>
<p>the last misfortune that you will ever suffer. Live,</p>
<p>and be happy, and make others so.”</p>
<p>As we returned, Elizabeth said, “You know not,</p>
<p>my dear Victor, how much I am relieved, now that</p>
<p>I trust in the innocence of this unfortunate girl. I</p>
<p>never could again have known peace, if I had been</p>
<p>deceived in my reliance on her. For the moment</p>
<p>that I did believe her guilty, I felt an anguish that</p>
<p>I could not have long sustained. Now my heart</p>
<p>is lightened. The innocent suffers; but she whom</p>
<p>I thought amiable and good has not betrayed the</p>
<p>trust I reposed in her, and I am consoled.”</p>
<p>Amiable cousin! such were your thoughts, mild</p>
<p>and gentle as your own dear eyes and voice. But I</p>
<p>— I was a wretch, and none ever conceived of the</p>
<p>misery that I then endured.</p>
<p>Volume II</p>
<p>144</p>
<p>Chapter I</p>
<p>NOTHING is more painful to the human mind, than,</p>
<p>after the feelings have been worked up by a quick</p>
<p>succession of events, the dead calmness of inac-</p>
<p>tion and certainty which follows, and deprives the</p>
<p>soul both of hope and fear. Justine died; she rested;</p>
<p>and I was alive. The blood ﬂowed freely in my veins,</p>
<p>but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on</p>
<p>my heart, which nothing could remove. Sleep ﬂed</p>
<p>from my eyes; I wandered like an evil spirit, for I</p>
<p>had committed deeds of mischief beyond descrip-</p>
<p>tion horrible, and more, much more, (I persuaded</p>
<p>myself) was yet behind. Yet my heart overﬂowed</p>
<p>145</p>
<p>with kindness, and the love of virtue. I had begun</p>
<p>life with benevolent intentions, and thirsted for the</p>
<p>moment when I should put them in practice, and</p>
<p>make myself useful to my fellow-beings. Now all</p>
<p>was blasted: instead of that serenity of conscience,</p>
<p>which allowed me to look back upon the past with</p>
<p>self-satisfaction, and from thence to gather promise</p>
<p>of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and the</p>
<p>sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of</p>
<p>intense tortures, such as no language can describe.</p>
<p>This state of mind preyed upon my health, which</p>
<p>had entirely recovered from the ﬁrst shock it had</p>
<p>sustained. I shunned the face of man; all sound</p>
<p>of joy or complacency was torture to me; solitude</p>
<p>was my only consolation — deep, dark, death-like</p>
<p>solitude.</p>
<p>My father observed with pain the alteration per-</p>
<p>ceptible in my disposition and habits, and endeav-</p>
<p>oured to reason with me on the folly of giving way</p>
<p>to immoderate grief. “Do you think, Victor,” said he,</p>
<p>“that I do not suffer also? No one could love a child</p>
<p>more than I loved your brother;” (tears came into</p>
<p>his eyes as he spoke); “but is it not a duty to the</p>
<p>survivors, that we should refrain from augmenting</p>
<p>their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate</p>
<p>grief? It is also a duty owed to yourself; for exces-</p>
<p>sive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment,</p>
<p>or even the discharge of daily usefulness, without</p>
<p>which no man is ﬁt for society.”</p>
<p>This advice, although good, was totally inappli-</p>
<p>cable to my case; I should have been the ﬁrst to</p>
<p>hide my grief, and console my friends, if remorse</p>
<p>had not mingled its bitterness with my other sen-</p>
<p>sations. Now I could only answer my father with a</p>
<p>look of despair, and endeavour to hide myself from</p>
<p>his view.</p>
<p>About this time we retired to our house at Bel-</p>
<p>rive. This change was particularly agreeable to me.</p>
<p>The shutting of the gates regularly at ten o’clock,</p>
<p>and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after</p>
<p>that hour, had rendered our residence within the</p>
<p>walls of Geneva very irksome to me. I was now</p>
<p>free. Often, after the rest of the family had retired</p>
<p>for the night, I took the boat, and passed many</p>
<p>hours upon the water. Sometimes, with my sails</p>
<p>set, I was carried by the wind; and sometimes, after</p>
<p>rowing into the middle of the lake, I left the boat to</p>
<p>pursue its own course, and gave way to my own</p>
<p>miserable reﬂections. I was often tempted, when</p>
<p>all was at peace around me, and I the only unquiet</p>
<p>thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful</p>
<p>and heavenly, if I except some bat, or the frogs,</p>
<p>whose harsh and interrupted croaking was heard</p>
<p>only when I approached the shore — often, I say,</p>
<p>I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that</p>
<p>the waters might close over me and my calamities</p>
<p>for ever. But I was restrained, when I thought of</p>
<p>the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly</p>
<p>loved, and whose existence was bound up in mine.</p>
<p>I thought also of my father, and surviving brother:</p>
<p>should I by my base desertion leave them exposed</p>
<p>and unprotected to the malice of the ﬁend whom I</p>
<p>had let loose among them?</p>
<p>At these moments I wept bitterly, and wished</p>
<p>that peace would revisit my mind only that I might</p>
<p>afford them consolation and happiness. But that</p>
<p>could not be. Remorse extinguished every hope. I</p>
<p>had been the author of unalterable evils; and I lived</p>
<p>in daily fear, lest the monster whom I had created</p>
<p>should perpetrate some new wickedness. I had an</p>
<p>obscure feeling that all was not over, and that he</p>
<p>would still commit some signal crime, which by its</p>
<p>enormity should almost efface the recollection of</p>
<p>the past. There was always scope for fear, so long</p>
<p>as any thing I loved remained behind. My abhor-</p>
<p>rence of this ﬁend cannot be conceived. When I</p>
<p>thought of him, I gnashed my teeth, my eyes be-</p>
<p>came inﬂamed, and I ardently wished to extinguish</p>
<p>that life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed.</p>
<p>When I reﬂected on his crimes and malice, my ha-</p>
<p>tred and revenge burst all bounds of moderation. I</p>
<p>would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak</p>
<p>of the Andes, could I, when there, have precipitated</p>
<p>him to their base. I wished to see him again, that I</p>
<p>might wreak the utmost extent of anger on his head,</p>
<p>and avenge the deaths of William and Justine.</p>
<p>Our house was the house of mourning. My fa-</p>
<p>ther’s health was deeply shaken by the horror of the</p>
<p>recent events. Elizabeth was sad and desponding;</p>
<p>she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupa-</p>
<p>tions; all pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward</p>
<p>the dead; eternal woe and tears she then thought</p>
<p>was the just tribute she should pay to innocence</p>
<p>so blasted and destroyed. She was no longer that</p>
<p>happy creature, who in earlier youth wandered with</p>
<p>me on the banks of the lake, and talked with ec-</p>
<p>stacy of our future prospects. She had become</p>
<p>grave, and often conversed of the inconstancy of</p>
<p>fortune, and the instability of human life.</p>
<p>“When I reﬂect, my dear cousin,” said she, “on</p>
<p>the miserable death of Justine Moritz, I no longer</p>
<p>see the world and its works as they before appeared</p>
<p>to me. Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice</p>
<p>and injustice, that I read in books or heard from</p>
<p>others, as tales of ancient days, or imaginary evils;</p>
<p>at least they were remote, and more familiar to</p>
<p>reason than to the imagination; but now misery has</p>
<p>come home, and men appear to me as monsters</p>
<p>thirsting for each other’s blood. Yet I am certainly</p>
<p>unjust. Every body believed that poor girl to be</p>
<p>guilty; and if she could have committed the crime</p>
<p>for which she suffered, assuredly she would have</p>
<p>been the most depraved of human creatures. For</p>
<p>the sake of a few jewels, to have murdered the son</p>
<p>of her benefactor and friend, a child whom she had</p>
<p>nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if</p>
<p>it had been her own! I could not consent to the</p>
<p>death of any human being; but certainly I should</p>
<p>have thought such a creature unﬁt to remain in the</p>
<p>society of men. Yet she was innocent. I know, I feel</p>
<p>she was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and</p>
<p>that conﬁrms me. Alas! Victor, when falsehood can</p>
<p>look so like the truth, who can assure themselves</p>
<p>of certain happiness? I feel as if I were walking on</p>
<p>the edge of a precipice, towards which thousands</p>
<p>are crowding, and endeavouring to plunge me into</p>
<p>the abyss. William and Justine were assassinated,</p>
<p>and the murderer escapes; he walks about the</p>
<p>world free, and perhaps respected. But even if I</p>
<p>were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for the</p>
<p>same crimes, I would not change places with such</p>
<p>a wretch.”</p>
<p>I listened to this discourse with the extremest</p>
<p>agony. I, not in deed, but in effect, was the true</p>
<p>murderer. Elizabeth read my anguish in my counte-</p>
<p>nance, and kindly taking my hand said, “My dearest</p>
<p>cousin, you must calm yourself. These events have</p>
<p>affected me, God knows how deeply; but I am not</p>
<p>so wretched as you are. There is an expression of</p>
<p>despair, and sometimes of revenge, in your counte-</p>
<p>nance, that makes me tremble. Be calm, my dear</p>
<p>Victor; I would sacriﬁce my life to your peace. We</p>
<p>surely shall be happy: quiet in our native country,</p>
<p>and not mingling in the world, what can disturb our</p>
<p>tranquillity?”</p>
<p>She shed tears as she said this, distrusting the</p>
<p>very solace that she gave; but at the same time</p>
<p>she smiled, that she might chase away the ﬁend</p>
<p>that lurked in my heart. My father, who saw in the</p>
<p>unhappiness that was painted in my face only an</p>
<p>exaggeration of that sorrow which I might naturally</p>
<p>feel, thought that an amusement suited to my taste</p>
<p>would be the best means of restoring to me my</p>
<p>wonted serenity. It was from this cause that he had</p>
<p>removed to the country; and, induced by the same</p>
<p>motive, he now proposed that we should all make</p>
<p>an excursion to the valley of Chamounix. I had been</p>
<p>there before, but Elizabeth and Ernest never had;</p>
<p>and both had often expressed an earnest desire</p>
<p>to see the scenery of this place, which had been</p>
<p>described to them as so wonderful and sublime.</p>
<p>Accordingly we departed from Geneva on this tour</p>
<p>about the middle of the month of August, nearly two</p>
<p>months after the death of Justine.</p>
<p>The weather was uncommonly ﬁne; and if mine</p>
<p>had been a sorrow to be chased away by any ﬂeet-</p>
<p>ing circumstance, this excursion would certainly</p>
<p>have had the effect intended by my father. As it was,</p>
<p>I was somewhat interested in the scene; it some-</p>
<p>times lulled, although it could not extinguish my</p>
<p>grief. During the ﬁrst day we travelled in a carriage.</p>
<p>In the morning we had seen the mountains at a dis-</p>
<p>tance, towards which we gradually advanced. We</p>
<p>perceived that the valley through which we wound,</p>
<p>and which was formed by the river Arve, whose</p>
<p>course we followed, closed in upon us by degrees;</p>
<p>and when the sun had set, we beheld immense</p>
<p>mountains and precipices overhanging us on every</p>
<p>side, and heard the sound of the river raging among</p>
<p>rocks, and the dashing of water-falls around.</p>
<p>The next day we pursued our journey upon</p>
<p>mules; and as we ascended still higher, the valley</p>
<p>assumed a more magniﬁcent and astonishing char-</p>
<p>acter. Ruined castles hanging on the precipices of</p>
<p>piny mountains; the impetuous Arve, and cottages</p>
<p>every here and there peeping forth from among the</p>
<p>trees, formed a scene of singular beauty. But it was</p>
<p>augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty</p>
<p>Alps, whose white and shining pyramids and domes</p>
<p>towered above all, as belonging to another earth,</p>
<p>the habitations of another race of beings.</p>
<p>We passed the bridge of Pelissier, where the</p>
<p>ravine, which the river forms, opened before us, and</p>
<p>we began to ascend the mountain that overhangs it.</p>
<p>Soon after we entered the valley of Chamounix.</p>
<p>This valley is more wonderful and sublime, but</p>
<p>not so beautiful and picturesque as that of Servox,</p>
<p>through which we had just passed. The high and</p>
<p>snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries;</p>
<p>but we saw no more ruined castles and fertile ﬁelds.</p>
<p>Immense glaciers approached the road; we heard</p>
<p>the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche, and</p>
<p>marked the smoke of its passage. Mont Blânc, the</p>
<p>supreme and magniﬁcent Mont Blânc, raised itself</p>
<p>from the surrounding aiguilles, and its tremendous</p>
<p>dome overlooked the valley.</p>
<p>During this journey, I sometimes joined Eliza-</p>
<p>beth, and exerted myself to point out to her the</p>
<p>various beauties of the scene. I often suffered my</p>
<p>mule to lag behind, and indulged in the misery of</p>
<p>reﬂection. At other times I spurred on the animal</p>
<p>before my companions, that I might forget them,</p>
<p>the world, and, more than all, myself. When at a</p>
<p>distance, I alighted, and threw myself on the grass,</p>
<p>weighed down by horror and despair. At eight in</p>
<p>the evening I arrived at Chamounix. My father and</p>
<p>Elizabeth were very much fatigued; Ernest, who</p>
<p>accompanied us, was delighted, and in high spirits:</p>
<p>the only circumstance that detracted from his plea-</p>
<p>sure was the south wind, and the rain it seemed to</p>
<p>promise for the next day.</p>
<p>We retired early to our apartments, but not to</p>
<p>sleep; at least I did not. I remained many hours at</p>
<p>the window, watching the pallid lightning that played</p>
<p>above Mont Blânc, and listening to the rushing of</p>
<p>the Arve, which ran below my window.</p>
<p>Chapter II</p>
<p>THE next day, contrary to the prognostications of</p>
<p>our guides, was ﬁne, although clouded. We visited</p>
<p>the source of the Arveiron, and rode about the val-</p>
<p>ley until evening. These sublime and magniﬁcent</p>
<p>scenes afforded me the greatest consolation that I</p>
<p>was capable of receiving. They elevated me from</p>
<p>all littleness of feeling; and although they did not</p>
<p>remove my grief, they subdued and tranquillized it.</p>
<p>In some degree, also, they diverted my mind from</p>
<p>the thoughts over which it had brooded for the last</p>
<p>month. I returned in the evening, fatigued, but less</p>
<p>unhappy, and conversed with my family with more</p>
<p>157</p>
<p>cheerfulness than had been my custom for some</p>
<p>time. My father was pleased, and Elizabeth over-</p>
<p>joyed. “My dear cousin,” said she, “you see what</p>
<p>happiness you diffuse when you are happy; do not</p>
<p>relapse again!”</p>
<p>The following morning the rain poured down</p>
<p>in torrents, and thick mists hid the summits of the</p>
<p>mountains. I rose early, but felt unusually melan-</p>
<p>choly. The rain depressed me; my old feelings</p>
<p>recurred, and I was miserable. I knew how disap-</p>
<p>pointed my father would be at this sudden change,</p>
<p>and I wished to avoid him until I had recovered</p>
<p>myself so far as to be enabled to conceal those feel-</p>
<p>ings that overpowered me. I knew that they would</p>
<p>remain that day at the inn; and as I had ever inured</p>
<p>myself to rain, moisture, and cold, I resolved to go</p>
<p>alone to the summit of Montanvert. I remembered</p>
<p>the effect that the view of the tremendous and ever-</p>
<p>moving glacier had produced upon my mind when</p>
<p>I ﬁrst saw it. It had then ﬁlled me with a sublime</p>
<p>ecstacy that gave wings to the soul, and allowed</p>
<p>it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy.</p>
<p>The sight of the awful and majestic in nature had</p>
<p>indeed always the effect of solemnizing my mind,</p>
<p>and causing me to forget the passing cares of life. I</p>
<p>determined to go alone, for I was well acquainted</p>
<p>with the path, and the presence of another would</p>
<p>destroy the solitary grandeur of the scene.</p>
<p>The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut</p>
<p>into continual and short windings, which enable you</p>
<p>to surmount the perpendicularity of the mountain.</p>
<p>It is a scene terriﬁcally desolate. In a thousand</p>
<p>spots the traces of the winter avalanche may be</p>
<p>perceived, where trees lie broken and strewed on</p>
<p>the ground; some entirely destroyed, others bent,</p>
<p>leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain, or</p>
<p>transversely upon other trees. The path, as you</p>
<p>ascend higher, is intersected by ravines of snow,</p>
<p>down which stones continually roll from above; one</p>
<p>of them is particularly dangerous, as the slightest</p>
<p>sound, such as even speaking in a loud voice, pro-</p>
<p>duces a concussion of air sufﬁcient to draw destruc-</p>
<p>tion upon the head of the speaker. The pines are</p>
<p>not tall or luxuriant, but they are sombre, and add</p>
<p>an air of severity to the scene. I looked on the val-</p>
<p>ley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers</p>
<p>which ran through it, and curling in thick wreaths</p>
<p>around the opposite mountains, whose summits</p>
<p>were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain poured</p>
<p>from the dark sky, and added to the melancholy</p>
<p>impression I received from the objects around me.</p>
<p>Alas! why does man boast of sensibilities supe-</p>
<p>rior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders</p>
<p>them more necessary beings. If our impulses were</p>
<p>conﬁned to hunger, thirst, and desire, we might be</p>
<p>nearly free; but now we are moved by every wind</p>
<p>that blows, and a chance word or scene that that</p>
<p>word may convey to us.</p>
<p>We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.</p>
<p>We rise; one wand’ring thought pollutes the day.</p>
<p>We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh, or weep,</p>
<p>Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;</p>
<p>It is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow,</p>
<p>The path of its departure still is free.</p>
<p>Man’s yesterday may ne’er be like his morrow;</p>
<p>Nought may endure but mutability!</p>
<p>It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of</p>
<p>the ascent. For some time I sat upon the rock that</p>
<p>overlooks the sea of ice. A mist covered both that</p>
<p>and the surrounding mountains. Presently a breeze</p>
<p>dissipated the cloud, and I descended upon the</p>
<p>glacier. The surface is very uneven, rising like the</p>
<p>waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and inter-</p>
<p>spersed by rifts that sink deep. The ﬁeld of ice is al-</p>
<p>most a league in width, but I spent nearly two hours</p>
<p>in crossing it. The opposite mountain is a bare per-</p>
<p>pendicular rock. From the side where I now stood</p>
<p>Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance</p>
<p>of a league; and above it rose Mont Blânc, in awful</p>
<p>majesty. I remained in a recess of the rock, gaz-</p>
<p>ing on this wonderful and stupendous scene. The</p>
<p>sea, or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its</p>
<p>dependent mountains, whose aërial summits hung</p>
<p>over its recesses. Their icy and glittering peaks</p>
<p>shone in the sunlight over the clouds. My heart,</p>
<p>which was before sorrowful, now swelled with some-</p>
<p>thing like joy; I exclaimed — “Wandering spirits, if</p>
<p>indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow</p>
<p>beds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as</p>
<p>your companion, away from the joys of life.”</p>
<p>As I said this, I suddenly beheld the ﬁgure of a</p>
<p>man, at some distance, advancing towards me with</p>
<p>superhuman speed. He bounded over the crevices</p>
<p>in the ice, among which I had walked with caution;</p>
<p>his stature also, as he approached, seemed to ex-</p>
<p>ceed that of man. I was troubled: a mist came over</p>
<p>my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me; but I was</p>
<p>quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains. I</p>
<p>perceived, as the shape came nearer, (sight tremen-</p>
<p>dous and abhorred!) that it was the wretch whom I</p>
<p>had created. I trembled with rage and horror, resolv-</p>
<p>ing to wait his approach, and then close with him in</p>
<p>mortal combat. He approached; his countenance</p>
<p>bespoke bitter anguish, combined with disdain and</p>
<p>malignity, while its unearthly ugliness rendered it</p>
<p>almost too horrible for human eyes. But I scarcely</p>
<p>observed this; anger and hatred had at ﬁrst de-</p>
<p>prived me of utterance, and I recovered only to</p>
<p>overwhelm him with words expressive of furious</p>
<p>detestation and contempt.</p>
<p>“Devil!” I exclaimed, “do you dare approach</p>
<p>me? and do not you fear the ﬁerce vengeance of</p>
<p>my arm wreaked on your miserable head? Begone,</p>
<p>vile insect! or rather stay, that I may trample you</p>
<p>to dust! and, oh, that I could, with the extinction</p>
<p>of your miserable existence, restore those victims</p>
<p>whom you have so diabolically murdered!”</p>
<p>“I expected this reception,” said the dæmon. “All</p>
<p>men hate the wretched; how then must I be hated,</p>
<p>who am miserable beyond all living things! Yet you,</p>
<p>my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature, to</p>
<p>whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the</p>
<p>annihilation of one of us. You purpose to kill me.</p>
<p>How dare you sport thus with life? Do your duty</p>
<p>towards me, and I will do mine towards you and</p>
<p>the rest of mankind. If you will comply with my</p>
<p>conditions, I will leave them and you at peace; but</p>
<p>if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it be</p>
<p>satiated with the blood of your remaining friends.”</p>
<p>“Abhorred monster! ﬁend that thou art! the</p>
<p>tortures of hell are too mild a vengeance for thy</p>
<p>crimes. Wretched devil! you reproach me with your</p>
<p>creation; come on then, that I may extinguish the</p>
<p>spark which I so negligently bestowed.”</p>
<p>My rage was without bounds; I sprang on him,</p>
<p>impelled by all the feelings which can arm one being</p>
<p>against the existence of another.</p>
<p>He easily eluded me, and said,</p>
<p>“Be calm! I entreat you to hear me, before you</p>
<p>give vent to your hatred on my devoted head. Have</p>
<p>I not suffered enough, that you seek to increase my</p>
<p>misery? Life, although it may only be an accumu-</p>
<p>lation of anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend</p>
<p>it. Remember, thou hast made me more powerful</p>
<p>than thyself; my height is superior to thine; my joints</p>
<p>more supple. But I will not be tempted to set myself</p>
<p>in opposition to thee. I am thy creature, and I will</p>
<p>be even mild and docile to my natural lord and king,</p>
<p>if thou wilt also perform thy part, the which thou</p>
<p>owest me. Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to</p>
<p>every other, and trample upon me alone, to whom</p>
<p>thy justice, and even thy clemency and affection,</p>
<p>is most due. Remember, that I am thy creature: I</p>
<p>ought to be thy Adam; but I am rather the fallen</p>
<p>angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed.</p>
<p>Every where I see bliss, from which I alone am ir-</p>
<p>revocably excluded. I was benevolent and good;</p>
<p>misery made me a ﬁend. Make me happy, and I</p>
<p>shall again be virtuous.”</p>
<p>“Begone! I will not hear you. There can be no</p>
<p>community between you and me; we are enemies.</p>
<p>Begone, or let us try our strength in a ﬁght, in which</p>
<p>one must fall.”</p>
<p>“How can I move thee? Will no entreaties cause</p>
<p>thee to turn a favourable eye upon thy creature,</p>
<p>who implores thy goodness and compassion? Be-</p>
<p>lieve me, Frankenstein: I was benevolent; my soul</p>
<p>glowed with love and humanity: but am I not alone,</p>
<p>miserably alone? You, my creator, abhor me; what</p>
<p>hope can I gather from your fellow-creatures, who</p>
<p>owe me nothing? they spurn and hate me. The</p>
<p>desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge.</p>
<p>I have wandered here many days; the caves of ice,</p>
<p>which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and</p>
<p>the only one which man does not grudge. These</p>
<p>bleak skies I hail, for they are kinder to me than your</p>
<p>fellow-beings. If the multitude of mankind knew of</p>
<p>my existence, they would do as you do, and arm</p>
<p>themselves for my destruction. Shall I not then hate</p>
<p>them who abhor me? I will keep no terms with</p>
<p>my enemies. I am miserable, and they shall share</p>
<p>my wretchedness. Yet it is in your power to rec-</p>
<p>ompense me, and deliver them from an evil which</p>
<p>it only remains for you to make so great, that not</p>
<p>only you and your family, but thousands of others,</p>
<p>shall be swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage.</p>
<p>Let your compassion be moved, and do not disdain</p>
<p>me. Listen to my tale: when you have heard that,</p>
<p>abandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge</p>
<p>that I deserve. But hear me. The guilty are allowed,</p>
<p>by human laws, bloody as they may be, to speak</p>
<p>in their own defence before they are condemned.</p>
<p>Listen to me, Frankenstein. You accuse me of mur-</p>
<p>der; and yet you would, with a satisﬁed conscience,</p>
<p>destroy your own creature. Oh, praise the eternal</p>
<p>justice of man! Yet I ask you not to spare me: listen</p>
<p>to me; and then, if you can, and if you will, destroy</p>
<p>the work of your hands.”</p>
<p>“Why do you call to my remembrance circum-</p>
<p>stances of which I shudder to reﬂect, that I have</p>
<p>been the miserable origin and author? Cursed be</p>
<p>the day, abhorred devil, in which you ﬁrst saw light!</p>
<p>Cursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that</p>
<p>formed you! You have made me wretched beyond</p>
<p>expression. You have left me no power to consider</p>
<p>whether I am just to you, or not. Begone! relieve</p>
<p>me from the sight of your detested form.”</p>
<p>“Thus I relieve thee, my creator,” he said, and</p>
<p>placed his hated hands before my eyes, which I</p>
<p>ﬂung from me with violence; “thus I take from thee</p>
<p>a sight which you abhor. Still thou canst listen to me,</p>
<p>and grant me thy compassion. By the virtues that</p>
<p>I once possessed, I demand this from you. Hear</p>
<p>my tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature</p>
<p>of this place is not ﬁtting to your ﬁne sensations;</p>
<p>come to the hut upon the mountain. The sun is</p>
<p>yet high in the heavens; before it descends to hide</p>
<p>itself behind yon snowy precipices, and illuminate</p>
<p>another world, you will have heard my story, and</p>
<p>can decide. On you it rests, whether I quit for ever</p>
<p>the neighbourhood of man, and lead a harmless</p>
<p>life, or become the scourge of your fellow-creatures,</p>
<p>and the author of your own speedy ruin.”</p>
<p>As he said this, he led the way across the ice:</p>
<p>I followed. My heart was full, and I did not answer</p>
<p>him; but, as I proceeded, I weighed the various ar-</p>
<p>guments that he had used, and determined at least</p>
<p>to listen to his tale. I was partly urged by curiosity,</p>
<p>and compassion conﬁrmed my resolution. I had</p>
<p>hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my</p>
<p>brother, and I eagerly sought a conﬁrmation or de-</p>
<p>nial of this opinion. For the ﬁrst time, also, I felt what</p>
<p>the duties of a creator towards his creature were,</p>
<p>and that I ought to render him happy before I com-</p>
<p>plained of his wickedness. These motives urged</p>
<p>me to comply with his demand. We crossed the ice,</p>
<p>therefore, and ascended the opposite rock. The air</p>
<p>was cold, and the rain again began to descend: we</p>
<p>entered the hut, the ﬁend with an air of exultation,</p>
<p>I with a heavy heart, and depressed spirits. But I</p>
<p>consented to listen; and, seating myself by the ﬁre</p>
<p>which my odious companion had lighted, he thus</p>
<p>began his tale.</p>
<p>Chapter III</p>
<p>“IT is with considerable difﬁculty that I remember</p>
<p>the original æra of my being: all the events of that</p>
<p>period appear confused and indistinct. A strange</p>
<p>multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt,</p>
<p>heard, and smelt, at the same time; and it was,</p>
<p>indeed, a long time before I learned to distinguish</p>
<p>between the operations of my various senses. By</p>
<p>degrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon</p>
<p>my nerves, so that I was obliged to shut my eyes.</p>
<p>Darkness then came over me, and troubled me; but</p>
<p>hardly had I felt this, when, by opening my eyes,</p>
<p>as I now suppose, the light poured in upon me</p>
<p>170</p>
<p>again. I walked, and, I believe, descended; but I</p>
<p>presently found a great alteration in my sensations.</p>
<p>Before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded</p>
<p>me, impervious to my touch or sight; but I now found</p>
<p>that I could wander on at liberty, with no obstacles</p>
<p>which I could not either surmount or avoid. The</p>
<p>light became more and more oppressive to me;</p>
<p>and, the heat wearying me as I walked, I sought a</p>
<p>place where I could receive shade. This was the</p>
<p>forest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a</p>
<p>brook resting from my fatigue, until I felt tormented</p>
<p>by hunger and thirst. This roused me from my</p>
<p>nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which</p>
<p>I found hanging on the trees, or lying on the ground.</p>
<p>I slaked my thirst at the brook; and then lying down,</p>
<p>was overcome by sleep.</p>
<p>“It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and</p>
<p>half-frightened as it were instinctively, ﬁnding myself</p>
<p>so desolate. Before I had quitted your apartment,</p>
<p>on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with</p>
<p>some clothes; but these were insufﬁcient to secure</p>
<p>me from the dews of night. I was a poor, helpless,</p>
<p>miserable wretch; I knew, and could distinguish,</p>
<p>nothing; but, feeling pain invade me on all sides, I</p>
<p>sat down and wept.</p>
<p>“Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens, and</p>
<p>gave me a sensation of pleasure. I started up, and</p>
<p>beheld a radiant form rise from among the trees.</p>
<p>I gazed with a kind of wonder. It moved slowly,</p>
<p>but it enlightened my path; and I again went out</p>
<p>in search of berries. I was still cold, when under</p>
<p>one of the trees I found a huge cloak, with which I</p>
<p>covered myself, and sat down upon the ground. No</p>
<p>distinct ideas occupied my mind; all was confused.</p>
<p>I felt light, and hunger, and thirst, and darkness;</p>
<p>innumerable sounds rung in my ears, and on all</p>
<p>sides various scents saluted me: the only object</p>
<p>that I could distinguish was the bright moon, and I</p>
<p>ﬁxed my eyes on that with pleasure.</p>
<p>“Several changes of day and night passed, and</p>
<p>the orb of night had greatly lessened when I be-</p>
<p>gan to distinguish my sensations from each other. I</p>
<p>gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied</p>
<p>me with drink, and the trees that shaded me with</p>
<p>their foliage. I was delighted when I ﬁrst discov-</p>
<p>ered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted</p>
<p>my ears, proceeded from the throats of the little</p>
<p>winged animals who had often intercepted the light</p>
<p>from my eyes. I began also to observe, with greater</p>
<p>accuracy, the forms that surrounded me, and to</p>
<p>perceive the boundaries of the radiant roof of light</p>
<p>which canopied me. Sometimes I tried to imitate</p>
<p>the pleasant songs of the birds, but was unable.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in</p>
<p>my own mode, but the uncouth and inarticulate</p>
<p>sounds which broke from me frightened me into</p>
<p>silence again.</p>
<p>“The moon had disappeared from the night, and</p>
<p>again, with a lessened form, shewed itself, while I</p>
<p>still remained in the forest. My sensations had, by</p>
<p>this time, become distinct, and my mind received</p>
<p>every day additional ideas. My eyes became ac-</p>
<p>customed to the light, and to perceive objects in</p>
<p>their right forms; I distinguished the insect from</p>
<p>the herb, and, by degrees, one herb from another.</p>
<p>I found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh</p>
<p>notes, whilst those of the blackbird and thrush were</p>
<p>sweet and enticing.</p>
<p>“One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I</p>
<p>found a ﬁre which had been left by some wander-</p>
<p>ing beggars, and was overcome with delight at the</p>
<p>warmth I experienced from it. In my joy I thrust my</p>
<p>hand into the live embers, but quickly drew it out</p>
<p>again with a cry of pain. How strange, I thought,</p>
<p>that the same cause should produce such opposite</p>
<p>effects! I examined the materials of the ﬁre, and to</p>
<p>my joy found it to be composed of wood. I quickly</p>
<p>collected some branches; but they were wet, and</p>
<p>would not burn. I was pained at this, and sat still</p>
<p>watching the operation of the ﬁre. The wet wood</p>
<p>which I had placed near the heat dried, and itself</p>
<p>became inﬂamed. I reﬂected on this; and, by touch-</p>
<p>ing the various branches, I discovered the cause,</p>
<p>and busied myself in collecting a great quantity of</p>
<p>wood, that I might dry it, and have a plentiful supply</p>
<p>of ﬁre. When night came on, and brought sleep with</p>
<p>it, I was in the greatest fear lest my ﬁre should be</p>
<p>extinguished. I covered it carefully with dry wood</p>
<p>and leaves, and placed wet branches upon it; and</p>
<p>then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground, and</p>
<p>sunk into sleep.</p>
<p>“It was morning when I awoke, and my ﬁrst care</p>
<p>was to visit the ﬁre. I uncovered it, and a gentle</p>
<p>breeze quickly fanned it into a ﬂame. I observed this</p>
<p>also, and contrived a fan of branches, which roused</p>
<p>the embers when they were nearly extinguished.</p>
<p>When night came again, I found, with pleasure, that</p>
<p>the ﬁre gave light as well as heat; and that the</p>
<p>discovery of this element was useful to me in my</p>
<p>food; for I found some of the offals that the travellers</p>
<p>had left had been roasted, and tasted much more</p>
<p>savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees.</p>
<p>I tried, therefore, to dress my food in the same</p>
<p>manner, placing it on the live embers. I found that</p>
<p>the berries were spoiled by this operation, and the</p>
<p>nuts and roots much improved.</p>
<p>“Food, however, became scarce; and I often</p>
<p>spent the whole day searching in vain for a few</p>
<p>acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. When I</p>
<p>found this, I resolved to quit the place that I had</p>
<p>hitherto inhabited, to seek for one where the few</p>
<p>wants I experienced would be more easily satisﬁed.</p>
<p>In this emigration, I exceedingly lamented the loss</p>
<p>of the ﬁre which I had obtained through accident,</p>
<p>and knew not how to re-produce it. I gave several</p>
<p>hours to the serious consideration of this difﬁculty;</p>
<p>but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply</p>
<p>it; and, wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck</p>
<p>across the wood towards the setting sun. I passed</p>
<p>three days in these rambles, and at length discov-</p>
<p>ered the open country. A great fall of snow had</p>
<p>taken place the night before, and the ﬁelds were of</p>
<p>one uniform white; the appearance was disconso-</p>
<p>late, and I found my feet chilled by the cold damp</p>
<p>substance that covered the ground.</p>
<p>“It was about seven in the morning, and I longed</p>
<p>to obtain food and shelter; at length I perceived a</p>
<p>small hut, on a rising ground, which had doubtless</p>
<p>been built for the convenience of some shepherd.</p>
<p>This was a new sight to me; and I examined the</p>
<p>structure with great curiosity. Finding the door open,</p>
<p>I entered. An old man sat in it, near a ﬁre, over</p>
<p>which he was preparing his breakfast. He turned</p>
<p>on hearing a noise; and, perceiving me, shrieked</p>
<p>loudly, and, quitting the hut, ran across the ﬁelds</p>
<p>with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly ap-</p>
<p>peared capable. His appearance, different from any</p>
<p>I had ever before seen, and his ﬂight, somewhat</p>
<p>surprised me. But I was enchanted by the appear-</p>
<p>ance of the hut: here the snow and rain could not</p>
<p>penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to</p>
<p>me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as Pandæ-</p>
<p>monium appeared to the dæmons of hell after their</p>
<p>sufferings in the lake of ﬁre. I greedily devoured the</p>
<p>remnants of the shepherd’s breakfast, which con-</p>
<p>sisted of bread, cheese, milk, and wine; the latter,</p>
<p>however, I did not like. Then overcome by fatigue, I</p>
<p>lay down among some straw, and fell asleep.</p>
<p>“It was noon when I awoke; and, allured by the</p>
<p>warmth of the sun, which shone brightly on the</p>
<p>white ground, I determined to recommence my trav-</p>
<p>els; and, depositing the remains of the peasant’s</p>
<p>breakfast in a wallet I found, I proceeded across the</p>
<p>ﬁelds for several hours, until at sunset I arrived at a</p>
<p>village. How miraculous did this appear! the huts,</p>
<p>the neater cottages, and stately houses, engaged</p>
<p>my admiration by turns. The vegetables in the gar-</p>
<p>dens, the milk and cheese that I saw placed at the</p>
<p>windows of some of the cottages, allured my ap-</p>
<p>petite. One of the best of these I entered; but I had</p>
<p>hardly placed my foot within the door, before the</p>
<p>children shrieked, and one of the women fainted.</p>
<p>The whole village was roused; some ﬂed, some at-</p>
<p>tacked me, until, grievously bruised by stones and</p>
<p>many other kinds of missile weapons, I escaped</p>
<p>to the open country, and fearfully took refuge in</p>
<p>a low hovel, quite bare, and making a wretched</p>
<p>appearance after the palaces I had beheld in the</p>
<p>village. This hovel, however, joined a cottage of a</p>
<p>neat and pleasant appearance; but, after my late</p>
<p>dearly-bought experience, I dared not enter it. My</p>
<p>place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so</p>
<p>low, that I could with difﬁculty sit upright in it. No</p>
<p>wood, however, was placed on the earth, which</p>
<p>formed the ﬂoor, but it was dry; and although the</p>
<p>wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an</p>
<p>agreeable asylum from the snow and rain.</p>
<p>“Here then I retreated, and lay down, happy to</p>
<p>have found a shelter, however miserable, from the</p>
<p>inclemency of the season, and still more from the</p>
<p>barbarity of man.</p>
<p>“As soon as morning dawned, I crept from my</p>
<p>kennel, that I might view the adjacent cottage, and</p>
<p>discover if I could remain in the habitation I had</p>
<p>found. It was situated against the back of the cot-</p>
<p>tage, and surrounded on the sides which were ex-</p>
<p>posed by a pig-stye and a clear pool of water. One</p>
<p>part was open, and by that I had crept in; but now</p>
<p>I covered every crevice by which I might be per-</p>
<p>ceived with stones and wood, yet in such a manner</p>
<p>that I might move them on occasion to pass out: all</p>
<p>the light I enjoyed came through the stye, and that</p>
<p>was sufﬁcient for me.</p>
<p>“Having thus arranged my dwelling, and car-</p>
<p>peted it with clean straw, I retired; for I saw the</p>
<p>ﬁgure of a man at a distance, and I remembered</p>
<p>too well my treatment the night before, to trust my-</p>
<p>self in his power. I had ﬁrst, however, provided</p>
<p>for my sustenance for that day, by a loaf of coarse</p>
<p>bread, which I purloined, and a cup with which I</p>
<p>could drink, more conveniently than from my hand,</p>
<p>of the pure water which ﬂowed by my retreat. The</p>
<p>ﬂoor was a little raised, so that it was kept perfectly</p>
<p>dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage</p>
<p>it was tolerably warm.</p>
<p>“Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this</p>
<p>hovel, until something should occur which might</p>
<p>alter my determination. It was indeed a paradise,</p>
<p>compared to the bleak forest, my former residence,</p>
<p>the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth. I ate</p>
<p>my breakfast with pleasure, and was about to re-</p>
<p>move a plank to procure myself a little water, when</p>
<p>I heard a step, and, looking through a small chink,</p>
<p>I beheld a young creature, with a pail on her head,</p>
<p>passing before my hovel. The girl was young and of</p>
<p>gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found</p>
<p>cottagers and farm-house servants to be. Yet she</p>
<p>was meanly dressed, a coarse blue petticoat and</p>
<p>a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair hair was</p>
<p>plaited, but not adorned; she looked patient, yet</p>
<p>sad. I lost sight of her; and in about a quarter of an</p>
<p>hour she returned, bearing the pail, which was now</p>
<p>partly ﬁlled with milk. As she walked along, seem-</p>
<p>ingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met</p>
<p>her, whose countenance expressed a deeper de-</p>
<p>spondence. Uttering a few sounds with an air of</p>
<p>melancholy, he took the pail from her head, and</p>
<p>bore it to the cottage himself. She followed, and</p>
<p>they disappeared. Presently I saw the young man</p>
<p>again, with some tools in his hand, cross the ﬁeld</p>
<p>behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied,</p>
<p>sometimes in the house, and sometimes in the</p>
<p>yard.</p>
<p>“On examining my dwelling, I found that one of</p>
<p>the windows of the cottage had formerly occupied</p>
<p>a part of it, but the panes had been ﬁlled up with</p>
<p>wood. In one of these was a small and almost im-</p>
<p>perceptible chink, through which the eye could just</p>
<p>penetrate. Through this crevice, a small room was</p>
<p>visible, white-washed and clean, but very bare of</p>
<p>furniture. In one corner, near a small ﬁre, sat an</p>
<p>old man, leaning his head on his hands in a dis-</p>
<p>consolate attitude. The young girl was occupied in</p>
<p>arranging the cottage; but presently she took some-</p>
<p>thing out of a drawer, which employed her hands,</p>
<p>and she sat down beside the old man, who, taking</p>
<p>up an instrument, began to play, and to produce</p>
<p>sounds, sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the</p>
<p>nightingale. It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor</p>
<p>wretch! who had never beheld aught beautiful be-</p>
<p>fore. The silver hair and benevolent countenance</p>
<p>of the aged cottager, won my reverence; while the</p>
<p>gentle manners of the girl enticed my love. He</p>
<p>played a sweet mournful air, which I perceived drew</p>
<p>tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of</p>
<p>which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed</p>
<p>audibly; he then pronounced a few sounds, and</p>
<p>the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt at his feet.</p>
<p>He raised her, and smiled with such kindness and</p>
<p>affection, that I felt sensations of a peculiar and</p>
<p>over-powering nature: they were a mixture of pain</p>
<p>and pleasure, such as I had never before experi-</p>
<p>enced, either from hunger or cold, warmth or food;</p>
<p>and I withdrew from the window, unable to bear</p>
<p>these emotions.</p>
<p>“Soon after this the young man returned, bear-</p>
<p>ing on his shoulders a load of wood. The girl met</p>
<p>him at the door, helped to relieve him of his bur-</p>
<p>den, and, taking some of the fuel into the cottage,</p>
<p>placed it on the ﬁre; then she and the youth went</p>
<p>apart into a nook of the cottage, and he shewed her</p>
<p>a large loaf and a piece of cheese. She seemed</p>
<p>pleased; and went into the garden for some roots</p>
<p>and plants, which she placed in water, and then</p>
<p>upon the ﬁre. She afterwards continued her work,</p>
<p>whilst the young man went into the garden, and</p>
<p>appeared busily employed in digging and pulling</p>
<p>up roots. After he had been employed thus about</p>
<p>an hour, the young woman joined him, and they</p>
<p>entered the cottage together.</p>
<p>“The old man had, in the mean time, been pen-</p>
<p>sive; but, on the appearance of his companions, he</p>
<p>assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to</p>
<p>eat. The meal was quickly dispatched. The young</p>
<p>woman was again occupied in arranging the cot-</p>
<p>tage; the old man walked before the cottage in the</p>
<p>sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the</p>
<p>youth. Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast</p>
<p>between these two excellent creatures. One was</p>
<p>old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming</p>
<p>with benevolence and love: the younger was slight</p>
<p>and graceful in his ﬁgure, and his features were</p>
<p>moulded with the ﬁnest symmetry; yet his eyes and</p>
<p>attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despon-</p>
<p>dency. The old man returned to the cottage; and</p>
<p>the youth, with tools different from those he had</p>
<p>used in the morning, directed his steps across the</p>
<p>ﬁelds.</p>
<p>“Night quickly shut in; but, to my extreme won-</p>
<p>der, I found that the cottagers had a means of pro-</p>
<p>longing light, by the use of tapers, and was de-</p>
<p>lighted to ﬁnd, that the setting of the sun did not put</p>
<p>an end to the pleasure I experienced in watching</p>
<p>my human neighbours. In the evening, the young</p>
<p>girl and her companion were employed in various</p>
<p>occupations which I did not understand; and the</p>
<p>old man again took up the instrument, which pro-</p>
<p>duced the divine sounds that had enchanted me</p>
<p>in the morning. So soon as he had ﬁnished, the</p>
<p>youth began, not to play, but to utter sounds that</p>
<p>were monotonous, and neither resembling the har-</p>
<p>mony of the old man’s instrument or the songs of</p>
<p>the birds; I since found that he read aloud, but at</p>
<p>that time I knew nothing of the science of words or</p>
<p>letters.</p>
<p>“The family, after having been thus occupied for</p>
<p>a short time, extinguished their lights, and retired,</p>
<p>as I conjectured, to rest.”</p>
<p>Chapter IV</p>
<p>“I LAY on my straw, but I could not sleep. I thought</p>
<p>of the occurrences of the day. What chieﬂy struck</p>
<p>me was the gentle manners of these people; and I</p>
<p>longed to join them, but dared not. I remembered</p>
<p>too well the treatment I had suffered the night before</p>
<p>from the barbarous villagers, and resolved, what-</p>
<p>ever course of conduct I might hereafter think it</p>
<p>right to pursue, that for the present I would remain</p>
<p>quietly in my hovel, watching, and endeavouring to</p>
<p>discover the motives which inﬂuenced their actions.</p>
<p>“The cottagers arose the next morning before</p>
<p>the sun. The young woman arranged the cottage,</p>
<p>186</p>
<p>and prepared the food; and the youth departed after</p>
<p>the ﬁrst meal.</p>
<p>“This day was passed in the same routine as</p>
<p>that which preceded it. The young man was con-</p>
<p>stantly employed out of doors, and the girl in various</p>
<p>laborious occupations within. The old man, whom</p>
<p>I soon perceived to be blind, employed his leisure</p>
<p>hours on his instrument, or in contemplation. Noth-</p>
<p>ing could exceed the love and respect which the</p>
<p>younger cottagers exhibited towards their venera-</p>
<p>ble companion. They performed towards him every</p>
<p>little ofﬁce of affection and duty with gentleness;</p>
<p>and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles.</p>
<p>“They were not entirely happy. The young man</p>
<p>and his companion often went apart, and appeared</p>
<p>to weep. I saw no cause for their unhappiness;</p>
<p>but I was deeply affected by it. If such lovely crea-</p>
<p>tures were miserable, it was less strange that I, an</p>
<p>imperfect and solitary being, should be wretched.</p>
<p>Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy? They</p>
<p>possessed a delightful house (for such it was in my</p>
<p>eyes), and every luxury; they had a ﬁre to warm</p>
<p>them when chill, and delicious viands when hun-</p>
<p>gry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and,</p>
<p>still more, they enjoyed one another’s company and</p>
<p>speech, interchanging each day looks of affection</p>
<p>and kindness. What did their tears imply? Did they</p>
<p>really express pain? I was at ﬁrst unable to solve</p>
<p>these questions; but perpetual attention, and time,</p>
<p>explained to me many appearances which were at</p>
<p>ﬁrst enigmatic.</p>
<p>“A considerable period elapsed before I discov-</p>
<p>ered one of the causes of the uneasiness of this</p>
<p>amiable family; it was poverty: and they suffered</p>
<p>that evil in a very distressing degree. Their nourish-</p>
<p>ment consisted entirely of the vegetables of their</p>
<p>garden, and the milk of one cow, who gave very little</p>
<p>during the winter, when its masters could scarcely</p>
<p>procure food to support it. They often, I believe,</p>
<p>suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, espe-</p>
<p>cially the two younger cottagers; for several times</p>
<p>they placed food before the old man, when they</p>
<p>reserved none for themselves.</p>
<p>“This trait of kindness moved me sensibly. I</p>
<p>had been accustomed, during the night, to steal</p>
<p>a part of their store for my own consumption; but</p>
<p>when I found that in doing this I inﬂicted pain on</p>
<p>the cottagers, I abstained, and satisﬁed myself with</p>
<p>berries, nuts, and roots, which I gathered from a</p>
<p>neighbouring wood.</p>
<p>“I discovered also another means through which</p>
<p>I was enabled to assist their labours. I found that</p>
<p>the youth spent a great part of each day in collect-</p>
<p>ing wood for the family ﬁre; and, during the night, I</p>
<p>often took his tools, the use of which I quickly dis-</p>
<p>covered, and brought home ﬁring sufﬁcient for the</p>
<p>consumption of several days.</p>
<p>“I remember, the ﬁrst time that I did this, the</p>
<p>young woman, when she opened the door in the</p>
<p>morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing</p>
<p>a great pile of wood on the outside. She uttered</p>
<p>some words in a loud voice, and the youth joined</p>
<p>her, who also expressed surprise. I observed, with</p>
<p>pleasure, that he did not go to the forest that day,</p>
<p>but spent it in repairing the cottage, and cultivating</p>
<p>the garden.</p>
<p>“By degrees I made a discovery of still greater</p>
<p>moment. I found that these people possessed a</p>
<p>method of communicating their experience and feel-</p>
<p>ings to one another by articulate sounds. I per-</p>
<p>ceived that the words they spoke sometimes pro-</p>
<p>duced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the</p>
<p>minds and countenances of the hearers. This was</p>
<p>indeed a godlike science, and I ardently desired</p>
<p>to become acquainted with it. But I was bafﬂed in</p>
<p>every attempt I made for this purpose. Their pronun-</p>
<p>ciation was quick; and the words they uttered, not</p>
<p>having any apparent connexion with visible objects,</p>
<p>I was unable to discover any clue by which I could</p>
<p>unravel the mystery of their reference. By great</p>
<p>application, however, and after having remained</p>
<p>during the space of several revolutions of the moon</p>
<p>in my hovel, I discovered the names that were given</p>
<p>to some of the most familiar objects of discourse: I</p>
<p>learned and applied the words ﬁre, milk, bread, and</p>
<p>wood. I learned also the names of the cottagers</p>
<p>themselves. The youth and his companion had</p>
<p>each of them several names, but the old man had</p>
<p>only one, which was father. The girl was called sis-</p>
<p>ter, or Agatha; and the youth Felix, brother, or son.</p>
<p>I cannot describe the delight I felt when I learned</p>
<p>the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds,</p>
<p>and was able to pronounce them. I distinguished</p>
<p>several other words, without being able as yet to</p>
<p>understand or apply them; such as good, dearest,</p>
<p>unhappy.</p>
<p>“I spent the winter in this manner. The gentle</p>
<p>manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly en-</p>
<p>deared them to me: when they were unhappy, I felt</p>
<p>depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathized in</p>
<p>their joys. I saw few human beings beside them;</p>
<p>and if any other happened to enter the cottage, their</p>
<p>harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me</p>
<p>the superior accomplishments of my friends. The</p>
<p>old man, I could perceive, often endeavoured to</p>
<p>encourage his children, as sometimes I found that</p>
<p>he called them, to cast off their melancholy. He</p>
<p>would talk in a cheerful accent, with an expression</p>
<p>of goodness that bestowed pleasure even upon me.</p>
<p>Agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes</p>
<p>ﬁlled with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe</p>
<p>away unperceived; but I generally found that her</p>
<p>countenance and tone were more cheerful after</p>
<p>having listened to the exhortations of her father. It</p>
<p>was not thus with Felix. He was always the saddest</p>
<p>of the groupe; and, even to my unpractised senses,</p>
<p>he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his</p>
<p>friends. But if his countenance was more sorrowful,</p>
<p>his voice was more cheerful than that of his sister,</p>
<p>especially when he addressed the old man.</p>
<p>“I could mention innumerable instances, which,</p>
<p>although slight, marked the dispositions of these</p>
<p>amiable cottagers. In the midst of poverty and want,</p>
<p>Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the ﬁrst</p>
<p>little white ﬂower that peeped out from beneath the</p>
<p>snowy ground. Early in the morning before she had</p>
<p>risen, he cleared away the snow that obstructed her</p>
<p>path to the milk-house, drew water from the well,</p>
<p>and brought the wood from the out-house, where,</p>
<p>to his perpetual astonishment, he found his store</p>
<p>always replenished by an invisible hand. In the day,</p>
<p>I believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring</p>
<p>farmer, because he often went forth, and did not</p>
<p>return until dinner, yet brought no wood with him. At</p>
<p>other times he worked in the garden; but, as there</p>
<p>was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the</p>
<p>old man and Agatha.</p>
<p>“This reading had puzzled me extremely at ﬁrst;</p>
<p>but, by degrees, I discovered that he uttered many</p>
<p>of the same sounds when he read as when he</p>
<p>talked. I conjectured, therefore, that he found on</p>
<p>the paper signs for speech which he understood,</p>
<p>and I ardently longed to comprehend these also;</p>
<p>but how was that possible, when I did not even un-</p>
<p>derstand the sounds for which they stood as signs?</p>
<p>I improved, however, sensibly in this science, but</p>
<p>not sufﬁciently to follow up any kind of conversation,</p>
<p>although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour:</p>
<p>for I easily perceived that, although I eagerly longed</p>
<p>to discover myself to the cottagers, I ought not to</p>
<p>make the attempt until I had ﬁrst become master of</p>
<p>their language; which knowledge might enable me</p>
<p>to make them overlook the deformity of my ﬁgure;</p>
<p>for with this also the contrast perpetually presented</p>
<p>to my eyes had made me acquainted.</p>
<p>“I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers</p>
<p>— their grace, beauty, and delicate complexions:</p>
<p>but how was I terriﬁed, when I viewed myself in a</p>
<p>transparent pool! At ﬁrst I started back, unable to</p>
<p>believe that it was indeed I who was reﬂected in</p>
<p>the mirror; and when I became fully convinced that</p>
<p>I was in reality the monster that I am, I was ﬁlled</p>
<p>with the bitterest sensations of despondence and</p>
<p>mortiﬁcation. Alas! I did not yet entirely know the</p>
<p>fatal effects of this miserable deformity.</p>
<p>“As the sun became warmer, and the light of</p>
<p>day longer, the snow vanished, and I beheld the</p>
<p>bare trees and the black earth. From this time</p>
<p>Felix was more employed; and the heart-moving</p>
<p>indications of impending famine disappeared. Their</p>
<p>food, as I afterwards found, was coarse, but it was</p>
<p>wholesome; and they procured a sufﬁciency of it.</p>
<p>Several new kinds of plants sprung up in the garden,</p>
<p>which they dressed; and these signs of comfort</p>
<p>increased daily as the season advanced.</p>
<p>“The old man, leaning on his son, walked each</p>
<p>day at noon, when it did not rain, as I found it was</p>
<p>called when the heavens poured forth its waters.</p>
<p>This frequently took place; but a high wind quickly</p>
<p>dried the earth, and the season became far more</p>
<p>pleasant than it had been.</p>
<p>“My mode of life in my hovel was uniform. Dur-</p>
<p>ing the morning I attended the motions of the cot-</p>
<p>tagers; and when they were dispersed in various</p>
<p>occupations, I slept: the remainder of the day was</p>
<p>spent in observing my friends. When they had re-</p>
<p>tired to rest, if there was any moon, or the night</p>
<p>was star-light, I went into the woods, and collected</p>
<p>my own food and fuel for the cottage. When I re-</p>
<p>turned, as often as it was necessary, I cleared their</p>
<p>path from the snow, and performed those ofﬁces</p>
<p>that I had seen done by Felix. I afterwards found</p>
<p>that these labours, performed by an invisible hand,</p>
<p>greatly astonished them; and once or twice I heard</p>
<p>them, on these occasions, utter the words good</p>
<p>spirit, wonderful; but I did not then understand the</p>
<p>signiﬁcation of these terms.</p>
<p>“My thoughts now became more active, and</p>
<p>I longed to discover the motives and feelings of</p>
<p>these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to know</p>
<p>why Felix appeared so miserable, and Agatha so</p>
<p>sad. I thought (foolish wretch!) that it might be in</p>
<p>my power to restore happiness to these deserving</p>
<p>people. When I slept, or was absent, the forms of</p>
<p>the venerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and</p>
<p>the excellent Felix, ﬂitted before me. I looked upon</p>
<p>them as superior beings, who would be the arbiters</p>
<p>of my future destiny. I formed in my imagination a</p>
<p>thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and</p>
<p>their reception of me. I imagined that they would</p>
<p>be disgusted, until, by my gentle demeanour and</p>
<p>conciliating words, I should ﬁrst win their favour,</p>
<p>and afterwards their love.</p>
<p>“These thoughts exhilarated me, and led me</p>
<p>to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring the art</p>
<p>of language. My organs were indeed harsh, but</p>
<p>supple; and although my voice was very unlike the</p>
<p>soft music of their tones, yet I pronounced such</p>
<p>words as I understood with tolerable ease. It was</p>
<p>as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle</p>
<p>ass, whose intentions were affectionate, although</p>
<p>his manners were rude, deserved better treatment</p>
<p>than blows and execration.</p>
<p>“The pleasant showers and genial warmth of</p>
<p>spring greatly altered the aspect of the earth. Men,</p>
<p>who before this change seemed to have been hid in</p>
<p>caves, dispersed themselves, and were employed</p>
<p>in various arts of cultivation. The birds sang in more</p>
<p>cheerful notes, and the leaves began to bud forth</p>
<p>on the trees. Happy, happy earth! ﬁt habitation</p>
<p>for gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak,</p>
<p>damp, and unwholesome. My spirits were elevated</p>
<p>by the enchanting appearance of nature; the past</p>
<p>was blotted from my memory, the present was tran-</p>
<p>quil, and the future gilded by bright rays of hope,</p>
<p>and anticipations of joy.”</p>
<p>Chapter V</p>
<p>“I NOW hasten to the more moving part of my story.</p>
<p>I shall relate events that impressed me with feelings</p>
<p>which, from what I was, have made me what I am.</p>
<p>“Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became</p>
<p>ﬁne, and the skies cloudless. It surprised me, that</p>
<p>what before was desert and gloomy should now</p>
<p>bloom with the most beautiful ﬂowers and verdure.</p>
<p>My senses were gratiﬁed and refreshed by a thou-</p>
<p>sand scents of delight, and a thousand sights of</p>
<p>beauty.</p>
<p>“It was on one of these days, when my cot-</p>
<p>tagers periodically rested from labour — the old</p>
<p>198</p>
<p>man played on his guitar, and the children listened</p>
<p>to him — I observed that the countenance of Felix</p>
<p>was melancholy beyond expression: he sighed fre-</p>
<p>quently; and once his father paused in his music,</p>
<p>and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired the</p>
<p>cause of his son’s sorrow. Felix replied in a cheerful</p>
<p>accent, and the old man was recommencing his</p>
<p>music, when some one tapped at the door.</p>
<p>“It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by</p>
<p>a countryman as a guide. The lady was dressed</p>
<p>in a dark suit, and covered with a thick black veil.</p>
<p>Agatha asked a question; to which the stranger</p>
<p>only replied by pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the</p>
<p>name of Felix. Her voice was musical, but unlike</p>
<p>that of either of my friends. On hearing this word,</p>
<p>Felix came up hastily to the lady; who, when she</p>
<p>saw him, threw up her veil, and I beheld a counte-</p>
<p>nance of angelic beauty and expression. Her hair</p>
<p>of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her</p>
<p>eyes were dark, but gentle, although animated; her</p>
<p>features of a regular proportion, and her complex-</p>
<p>ion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with a lovely</p>
<p>pink.</p>
<p>“Felix seemed ravished with delight when he</p>
<p>saw her, every trait of sorrow vanished from his</p>
<p>face, and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic</p>
<p>joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable;</p>
<p>his eyes sparkled, as his cheek ﬂushed with plea-</p>
<p>sure; and at that moment I thought him as beautiful</p>
<p>as the stranger. She appeared affected by different</p>
<p>feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes,</p>
<p>she held out her hand to Felix, who kissed it raptur-</p>
<p>ously, and called her, as well as I could distinguish,</p>
<p>his sweet Arabian. She did not appear to under-</p>
<p>stand him, but smiled. He assisted her to dismount,</p>
<p>and, dismissing her guide, conducted her into the</p>
<p>cottage. Some conversation took place between</p>
<p>him and his father; and the young stranger knelt at</p>
<p>the old man’s feet, and would have kissed his hand,</p>
<p>but he raised her, and embraced her affectionately.</p>
<p>“I soon perceived, that although the stranger</p>
<p>uttered articulate sounds, and appeared to have a</p>
<p>language of her own, she was neither understood</p>
<p>by, or herself understood, the cottagers. They made</p>
<p>many signs which I did not comprehend; but I saw</p>
<p>that her presence diffused gladness through the cot-</p>
<p>tage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates</p>
<p>the morning mists. Felix seemed peculiarly happy,</p>
<p>and with smiles of delight welcomed his Arabian.</p>
<p>Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed the hands</p>
<p>of the lovely stranger; and, pointing to her brother,</p>
<p>made signs which appeared to me to mean that he</p>
<p>had been sorrowful until she came. Some hours</p>
<p>passed thus, while they, by their countenances,</p>
<p>expressed joy, the cause of which I did not com-</p>
<p>prehend. Presently I found, by the frequent recur-</p>
<p>rence of one sound which the stranger repeated</p>
<p>after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their</p>
<p>language; and the idea instantly occurred to me,</p>
<p>that I should make use of the same instructions to</p>
<p>the same end. The stranger learned about twenty</p>
<p>words at the ﬁrst lesson, most of them indeed were</p>
<p>those which I had before understood, but I proﬁted</p>
<p>by the others.</p>
<p>“As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian</p>
<p>retired early. When they separated, Felix kissed</p>
<p>the hand of the stranger, and said, ‘Good night,</p>
<p>sweet Saﬁe.’ He sat up much longer, conversing</p>
<p>with his father; and, by the frequent repetition of her</p>
<p>name, I conjectured that their lovely guest was the</p>
<p>subject of their conversation. I ardently desired to</p>
<p>understand them, and bent every faculty towards</p>
<p>that purpose, but found it utterly impossible.</p>
<p>“The next morning Felix went out to his work;</p>
<p>and, after the usual occupations of Agatha were</p>
<p>ﬁnished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the old man,</p>
<p>and, taking his guitar, played some airs so entranc-</p>
<p>ingly beautiful, that they at once drew tears of sor-</p>
<p>row and delight from my eyes. She sang, and her</p>
<p>voice ﬂowed in a rich cadence, swelling or dying</p>
<p>away, like a nightingale of the woods.</p>
<p>“When she had ﬁnished, she gave the guitar to</p>
<p>Agatha, who at ﬁrst declined it. She played a sim-</p>
<p>ple air, and her voice accompanied it in sweet ac-</p>
<p>cents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger.</p>
<p>The old man appeared enraptured, and said some</p>
<p>words, which Agatha endeavoured to explain to</p>
<p>Saﬁe, and by which he appeared to wish to express</p>
<p>that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by</p>
<p>her music.</p>
<p>“The days now passed as peaceably as before,</p>
<p>with the sole alteration, that joy had taken place of</p>
<p>sadness in the countenances of my friends. Saﬁe</p>
<p>was always gay and happy; she and I improved</p>
<p>rapidly in the knowledge of language, so that in two</p>
<p>months I began to comprehend most of the words</p>
<p>uttered by my protectors.</p>
<p>“In the meanwhile also the black ground was</p>
<p>covered with herbage, and the green banks inter-</p>
<p>spersed with innumerable ﬂowers, sweet to the</p>
<p>scent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among</p>
<p>the moonlight woods; the sun became warmer, the</p>
<p>nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal rambles</p>
<p>were an extreme pleasure to me, although they</p>
<p>were considerably shortened by the late setting and</p>
<p>early rising of the sun; for I never ventured abroad</p>
<p>during daylight, fearful of meeting with the same</p>
<p>treatment as I had formerly endured in the ﬁrst vil-</p>
<p>lage which I entered.</p>
<p>“My days were spent in close attention, that I</p>
<p>might more speedily master the language; and I</p>
<p>may boast that I improved more rapidly than the</p>
<p>Arabian, who understood very little, and conversed</p>
<p>in broken accents, whilst I comprehended and could</p>
<p>imitate almost every word that was spoken.</p>
<p>“While I improved in speech, I also learned the</p>
<p>science of letters, as it was taught to the stranger;</p>
<p>and this opened before me a wide ﬁeld for wonder</p>
<p>and delight.</p>
<p>“The book from which Felix instructed Saﬁe was</p>
<p>Volney’s Ruins of Empires. I should not have un-</p>
<p>derstood the purport of this book, had not Felix, in</p>
<p>reading it, given very minute explanations. He had</p>
<p>chosen this work, he said, because the declama-</p>
<p>tory style was framed in imitation of the eastern</p>
<p>authors. Through this work I obtained a cursory</p>
<p>knowledge of history, and a view of the several em-</p>
<p>pires at present existing in the world; it gave me</p>
<p>an insight into the manners, governments, and reli-</p>
<p>gions of the different nations of the earth. I heard</p>
<p>of the slothful Asiatics; of the stupendous genius</p>
<p>and mental activity of the Grecians; of the wars and</p>
<p>wonderful virtue of the early Romans — of their</p>
<p>subsequent degeneration — of the decline of that</p>
<p>mighty empire; of chivalry, Christianity, and kings. I</p>
<p>heard of the discovery of the American hemisphere,</p>
<p>and wept with Saﬁe over the hapless fate of its</p>
<p>original inhabitants.</p>
<p>“These wonderful narrations inspired me with</p>
<p>strange feelings. Was man, indeed, at once so pow-</p>
<p>erful, so virtuous, and magniﬁcent, yet so vicious</p>
<p>and base? He appeared at one time a mere scion</p>
<p>of the evil principle, and at another as all that can</p>
<p>be conceived of noble and godlike. To be a great</p>
<p>and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that</p>
<p>can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious,</p>
<p>as many on record have been, appeared the lowest</p>
<p>degradation, a condition more abject than that of</p>
<p>the blind mole or harmless worm. For a long time I</p>
<p>could not conceive how one man could go forth to</p>
<p>murder his fellow, or even why there were laws and</p>
<p>governments; but when I heard details of vice and</p>
<p>bloodshed, my wonder ceased, and I turned away</p>
<p>with disgust and loathing.</p>
<p>“Every conversation of the cottagers now op-</p>
<p>ened new wonders to me. While I listened to the</p>
<p>instructions which Felix bestowed upon the Ara-</p>
<p>bian, the strange system of human society was</p>
<p>explained to me. I heard of the division of property,</p>
<p>of immense wealth and squalid poverty; of rank,</p>
<p>descent, and noble blood.</p>
<p>“The words induced me to turn towards my-</p>
<p>self. I learned that the possessions most esteemed</p>
<p>by your fellow-creatures were, high and unsullied</p>
<p>descent united with riches. A man might be re-</p>
<p>spected with only one of these acquisitions; but</p>
<p>without either he was considered, except in very</p>
<p>rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed</p>
<p>to waste his powers for the proﬁt of the chosen few.</p>
<p>And what was I? Of my creation and creator I was</p>
<p>absolutely ignorant; but I knew that I possessed</p>
<p>no money, no friends, no kind of property. I was,</p>
<p>besides, endowed with a ﬁgure hideously deformed</p>
<p>and loathsome; I was not even of the same nature</p>
<p>as man. I was more agile than they, and could sub-</p>
<p>sist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat</p>
<p>and cold with less injury to my frame; my stature far</p>
<p>exceeded their’s. When I looked around, I saw and</p>
<p>heard of none like me. Was I then a monster, a blot</p>
<p>upon the earth, from which all men ﬂed, and whom</p>
<p>all men disowned?</p>
<p>“I cannot describe to you the agony that these</p>
<p>reﬂections inﬂicted upon me; I tried to dispel them,</p>
<p>but sorrow only increased with knowledge. Oh,</p>
<p>that I had for ever remained in my native wood,</p>
<p>nor known or felt beyond the sensations of hunger,</p>
<p>thirst, and heat!</p>
<p>“Of what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings</p>
<p>to the mind, when it has once seized on it, like a</p>
<p>lichen on the rock. I wished sometimes to shake off</p>
<p>all thought and feeling; but I learned that there was</p>
<p>but one means to overcome the sensation of pain,</p>
<p>and that was death — a state which I feared yet did</p>
<p>not understand. I admired virtue and good feelings,</p>
<p>and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities</p>
<p>of my cottagers; but I was shut out from intercourse</p>
<p>with them, except through means which I obtained</p>
<p>by stealth, when I was unseen and unknown, and</p>
<p>which rather increased than satisﬁed the desire</p>
<p>I had of becoming one among my fellows. The</p>
<p>gentle words of Agatha, and the animated smiles</p>
<p>of the charming Arabian, were not for me. The</p>
<p>mild exhortations of the old man, and the lively</p>
<p>conversation of the loved Felix, were not for me.</p>
<p>Miserable, unhappy wretch!</p>
<p>“Other lessons were impressed upon me even</p>
<p>more deeply. I heard of the difference of sexes;</p>
<p>of the birth and growth of children; how the father</p>
<p>doated on the smiles of the infant, and the lively</p>
<p>sallies of the older child; how all the life and cares</p>
<p>of the mother were wrapt up in the precious charge;</p>
<p>how the mind of youth expanded and gained knowl-</p>
<p>edge; of brother, sister, and all the various relation-</p>
<p>ships which bind one human being to another in</p>
<p>mutual bonds.</p>
<p>“But where were my friends and relations? No</p>
<p>father had watched my infant days, no mother had</p>
<p>blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if they</p>
<p>had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy</p>
<p>in which I distinguished nothing. From my earliest</p>
<p>remembrance I had been as I then was in height</p>
<p>and proportion. I had never yet seen a being re-</p>
<p>sembling me, or who claimed any intercourse with</p>
<p>me. What was I? The question again recurred, to</p>
<p>be answered only with groans.</p>
<p>“I will soon explain to what these feelings</p>
<p>tended; but allow me now to return to the cottagers,</p>
<p>whose story excited in me such various feelings</p>
<p>of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all</p>
<p>terminated in additional love and reverence for my</p>
<p>protectors (for so I loved, in an innocent, half painful</p>
<p>self-deceit, to call them).”</p>
<p>Chapter VI</p>
<p>“SOME time elapsed before I learned the history</p>
<p>of my friends. It was one which could not fail to</p>
<p>impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding as it did</p>
<p>a number of circumstances each interesting and</p>
<p>wonderful to one so utterly inexperienced as I was.</p>
<p>“The name of the old man was De Lacey. He</p>
<p>was descended from a good family in France, where</p>
<p>he had lived for many years in afﬂuence, respected</p>
<p>by his superiors, and beloved by his equals. His son</p>
<p>was bred in the service of his country; and Agatha</p>
<p>had ranked with ladies of the highest distinction. A</p>
<p>few months before my arrival, they had lived in a</p>
<p>210</p>
<p>large and luxurious city, called Paris, surrounded by</p>
<p>friends, and possessed of every enjoyment which</p>
<p>virtue, reﬁnement of intellect, or taste, accompanied</p>
<p>by a moderate fortune, could afford.</p>
<p>“The father of Saﬁe had been the cause of their</p>
<p>ruin. He was a Turkish merchant, and had inhab-</p>
<p>ited Paris for many years, when, for some reason</p>
<p>which I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the</p>
<p>government. He was seized and cast into prison</p>
<p>the very day that Saﬁe arrived from Constantino-</p>
<p>ple to join him. He was tried, and condemned to</p>
<p>death. The injustice of his sentence was very ﬂa-</p>
<p>grant; all Paris was indignant; and it was judged</p>
<p>that his religion and wealth, rather than the crime</p>
<p>alleged against him, had been the cause of his</p>
<p>condemnation.</p>
<p>“Felix had been present at the trial; his hor-</p>
<p>ror and indignation were uncontrollable, when he</p>
<p>heard the decision of the court. He made, at that</p>
<p>moment, a solemn vow to deliver him, and then</p>
<p>looked around for the means. After many fruitless</p>
<p>attempts to gain admittance to the prison, he found</p>
<p>a strongly grated window in an unguarded part of</p>
<p>the building, which lighted the dungeon of the unfor-</p>
<p>tunate Mahometan; who, loaded with chains, waited</p>
<p>in despair the execution of the barbarous sentence.</p>
<p>Felix visited the grate at night, and made known</p>
<p>to the prisoner his intentions in his favour. The</p>
<p>Turk, amazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle</p>
<p>the zeal of his deliverer by promises of reward and</p>
<p>wealth. Felix rejected his offers with contempt; yet</p>
<p>when he saw the lovely Saﬁe, who was allowed</p>
<p>to visit her father, and who, by her gestures, ex-</p>
<p>pressed her lively gratitude, the youth could not</p>
<p>help owning to his own mind, that the captive pos-</p>
<p>sessed a treasure which would fully reward his toil</p>
<p>and hazard.</p>
<p>“The Turk quickly perceived the impression that</p>
<p>his daughter had made on the heart of Felix, and</p>
<p>endeavoured to secure him more entirely in his</p>
<p>interests by the promise of her hand in marriage, so</p>
<p>soon as he should be conveyed to a place of safety.</p>
<p>Felix was too delicate to accept this offer; yet he</p>
<p>looked forward to the probability of that event as to</p>
<p>the consummation of his happiness.</p>
<p>“During the ensuing days, while the prepara-</p>
<p>tions were going forward for the escape of the mer-</p>
<p>chant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several let-</p>
<p>ters that he received from this lovely girl, who found</p>
<p>means to express her thoughts in the language of</p>
<p>her lover by the aid of an old man, a servant of her</p>
<p>father’s, who understood French. She thanked him</p>
<p>in the most ardent terms for his intended services</p>
<p>towards her father; and at the same time she gently</p>
<p>deplored her own fate.</p>
<p>“I have copies of these letters; for I found means,</p>
<p>during my residence in the hovel, to procure the</p>
<p>implements of writing; and the letters were often in</p>
<p>the hands of Felix or Agatha. Before I depart, I will</p>
<p>give them to you, they will prove the truth of my tale;</p>
<p>but at present, as the sun is already far declined,</p>
<p>I shall only have time to repeat the substance of</p>
<p>them to you.</p>
<p>“Saﬁe related, that her mother was a Christian</p>
<p>Arab, seized and made a slave by the Turks; rec-</p>
<p>ommended by her beauty, she had won the heart</p>
<p>of the father of Saﬁe, who married her. The young</p>
<p>girl spoke in high and enthusiastic terms of her</p>
<p>mother, who, born in freedom spurned the bondage</p>
<p>to which she was now reduced. She instructed her</p>
<p>daughter in the tenets of her religion, and taught</p>
<p>her to aspire to higher powers of intellect, and an</p>
<p>independence of spirit, forbidden to the female fol-</p>
<p>lowers of Mahomet. This lady died; but her lessons</p>
<p>were indelibly impressed on the mind of Saﬁe, who</p>
<p>sickened at the prospect of again returning to Asia,</p>
<p>and the being immured within the walls of a haram,</p>
<p>allowed only to occupy herself with puerile amuse-</p>
<p>ments, ill suited to the temper of her soul, now</p>
<p>accustomed to grand ideas and a noble emulation</p>
<p>for virtue. The prospect of marrying a Christian,</p>
<p>and remaining in a country where women were al-</p>
<p>lowed to take a rank in society, was enchanting to</p>
<p>her.</p>
<p>“The day for the execution of the Turk was ﬁxed;</p>
<p>but, on the night previous to it, he had quitted prison,</p>
<p>and before morning was distant many leagues from</p>
<p>Paris. Felix had procured passports in the name</p>
<p>of his father, sister, and himself. He had previously</p>
<p>communicated his plan to the former, who aided the</p>
<p>deceit by quitting his house, under the pretence of</p>
<p>a journey, and concealed himself, with his daughter,</p>
<p>in an obscure part of Paris.</p>
<p>“Felix conducted the fugitives through France to</p>
<p>Lyons, and across Mont Cenis to Leghorn, where</p>
<p>the merchant had decided to wait a favourable op-</p>
<p>portunity of passing into some part of the Turkish</p>
<p>dominions.</p>
<p>“Saﬁe resolved to remain with her father until</p>
<p>the moment of his departure, before which time</p>
<p>the Turk renewed his promise that she should be</p>
<p>united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with</p>
<p>them in expectation of that event; and in the mean</p>
<p>time he enjoyed the society of the Arabian, who</p>
<p>exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest</p>
<p>affection. They conversed with one another through</p>
<p>the means of an interpreter, and sometimes with</p>
<p>the interpretation of looks; and Saﬁe sang to him</p>
<p>the divine airs of her native country.</p>
<p>“The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place,</p>
<p>and encouraged the hopes of the youthful lovers,</p>
<p>while in his heart he had formed far other plans. He</p>
<p>loathed the idea that his daughter should be united</p>
<p>to a Christian; but he feared the resentment of Felix</p>
<p>if he should appear lukewarm; for he knew that he</p>
<p>was still in the power of his deliverer, if he should</p>
<p>choose to betray him to the Italian state which they</p>
<p>inhabited. He revolved a thousand plans by which</p>
<p>he should be enabled to prolong the deceit until it</p>
<p>might be no longer necessary, and secretly to take</p>
<p>his daughter with him when he departed. His plans</p>
<p>were greatly facilitated by the news which arrived</p>
<p>from Paris.</p>
<p>“The government of France were greatly en-</p>
<p>raged at the escape of their victim, and spared no</p>
<p>pains to detect and punish his deliverer. The plot</p>
<p>of Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and</p>
<p>Agatha were thrown into prison. The news reached</p>
<p>Felix, and roused him from his dream of pleasure.</p>
<p>His blind and aged father, and his gentle sister, lay</p>
<p>in a noisome dungeon, while he enjoyed the free</p>
<p>air, and the society of her whom he loved. This</p>
<p>idea was torture to him. He quickly arranged with</p>
<p>the Turk, that if the latter should ﬁnd a favourable</p>
<p>opportunity for escape before Felix could return to</p>
<p>Italy, Saﬁe should remain as a boarder at a convent</p>
<p>at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian,</p>
<p>he hastened to Paris, and delivered himself up to</p>
<p>the vengeance of the law, hoping to free De Lacey</p>
<p>and Agatha by this proceeding.</p>
<p>“He did not succeed. They remained conﬁned</p>
<p>for ﬁve months before the trial took place; the result</p>
<p>of which deprived them of their fortune, and con-</p>
<p>demned them to a perpetual exile from their native</p>
<p>country.</p>
<p>“They found a miserable asylum in the cottage</p>
<p>in Germany, where I discovered them. Felix soon</p>
<p>learned that the treacherous Turk, for whom he</p>
<p>and his family endured such unheard-of oppres-</p>
<p>sion, on discovering that his deliverer was thus re-</p>
<p>duced to poverty and impotence, became a traitor</p>
<p>to good feeling and honour, and had quitted Italy</p>
<p>with his daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pit-</p>
<p>tance of money to aid him, as he said, in some plan</p>
<p>of future maintenance.</p>
<p>“Such were the events that preyed on the heart</p>
<p>of Felix, and rendered him, when I ﬁrst saw him,</p>
<p>the most miserable of his family. He could have</p>
<p>endured poverty, and when this distress had been</p>
<p>the meed of his virtue, he would have gloried in it:</p>
<p>but the ingratitude of the Turk, and the loss of his</p>
<p>beloved Saﬁe, were misfortunes more bitter and</p>
<p>irreparable. The arrival of the Arabian now infused</p>
<p>new life into his soul.</p>
<p>“When the news reached Leghorn, that Felix</p>
<p>was deprived of his wealth and rank, the merchant</p>
<p>commanded his daughter to think no more of her</p>
<p>lover, but to prepare to return with him to her na-</p>
<p>tive country. The generous nature of Saﬁe was</p>
<p>outraged by this command; she attempted to ex-</p>
<p>postulate with her father, but he left her angrily,</p>
<p>reiterating his tyrannical mandate.</p>
<p>“A few days after, the Turk entered his daugh-</p>
<p>ter’s apartment, and told her hastily, that he had</p>
<p>reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn</p>
<p>had been divulged, and that he should speedily</p>
<p>be delivered up to the French government; he had,</p>
<p>consequently, hired a vessel to convey him to Con-</p>
<p>stantinople, for which city he should sail in a few</p>
<p>hours. He intended to leave his daughter under</p>
<p>the care of a conﬁdential servant, to follow at her</p>
<p>leisure with the greater part of his property, which</p>
<p>had not yet arrived at Leghorn.</p>
<p>“When alone, Saﬁe resolved in her own mind</p>
<p>the plan of conduct that it would become her to</p>
<p>pursue in this emergency. A residence in Turkey</p>
<p>was abhorrent to her; her religion and feelings were</p>
<p>alike adverse to it. By some papers of her father’s,</p>
<p>which fell into her hands, she heard of the exile of</p>
<p>her lover, and learnt the name of the spot where</p>
<p>he then resided. She hesitated some time, but at</p>
<p>length she formed her determination. Taking with</p>
<p>her some jewels that belonged to her, and a small</p>
<p>sum of money, she quitted Italy, with an attendant, a</p>
<p>native of Leghorn, but who understood the common</p>
<p>language of Turkey, and departed for Germany.</p>
<p>“She arrived in safety at a town about twenty</p>
<p>leagues from the cottage of De Lacey, when her</p>
<p>attendant fell dangerously ill. Saﬁe nursed her with</p>
<p>the most devoted affection; but the poor girl died,</p>
<p>and the Arabian was left alone, unacquainted with</p>
<p>the language of the country, and utterly ignorant of</p>
<p>the customs of the world. She fell, however, into</p>
<p>good hands. The Italian had mentioned the name</p>
<p>of the spot for which they were bound; and, after</p>
<p>her death, the woman of the house in which they</p>
<p>had lived took care that Saﬁe should arrive in safety</p>
<p>at the cottage of her lover.”</p>
<p>Chapter VII</p>
<p>“SUCH was the history of my beloved cottagers. It</p>
<p>impressed me deeply. I learned, from the views of</p>
<p>social life which it developed, to admire their virtues,</p>
<p>and to deprecate the vices of mankind.</p>
<p>“As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil;</p>
<p>benevolence and generosity were ever present be-</p>
<p>fore me, inciting within me a desire to become an</p>
<p>actor in the busy scene where so many admirable</p>
<p>qualities were called forth and displayed. But, in</p>
<p>giving an account of the progress of my intellect, I</p>
<p>must not omit a circumstance which occurred in the</p>
<p>beginning of the month of August of the same year.</p>
<p>221</p>
<p>“One night, during my accustomed visit to the</p>
<p>neighbouring wood, where I collected my own food,</p>
<p>and brought home ﬁring for my protectors, I found</p>
<p>on the ground a leathern portmanteau, containing</p>
<p>several articles of dress and some books. I eagerly</p>
<p>seized the prize, and returned with it to my hovel.</p>
<p>Fortunately the books were written in the language</p>
<p>the elements of which I had acquired at the cot-</p>
<p>tage; they consisted of Paradise Lost, a volume of</p>
<p>Plutarch’s Lives, and the Sorrows of Werter. The</p>
<p>possession of these treasures gave me extreme</p>
<p>delight; I now continually studied and exercised my</p>
<p>mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were</p>
<p>employed in their ordinary occupations.</p>
<p>“I can hardly describe to you the effect of these</p>
<p>books. They produced in me an inﬁnity of new im-</p>
<p>ages and feelings, that sometimes raised me to</p>
<p>ecstacy, but more frequently sunk me into the low-</p>
<p>est dejection. In the Sorrows of Werter, besides the</p>
<p>interest of its simple and affecting story, so many</p>
<p>opinions are canvassed, and so many lights thrown</p>
<p>upon what had hitherto been to me obscure sub-</p>
<p>jects, that I found in it a never-ending source of</p>
<p>speculation and astonishment. The gentle and do-</p>
<p>mestic manners it described, combined with lofty</p>
<p>sentiments and feelings, which had for their object</p>
<p>something out of self, accorded well with my expe-</p>
<p>rience among my protectors, and with the wants</p>
<p>which were for ever alive in my own bosom. But I</p>
<p>thought Werter himself a more divine being than</p>
<p>I had ever beheld or imagined; his character con-</p>
<p>tained no pretension, but it sunk deep. The dis-</p>
<p>quisitions upon death and suicide were calculated</p>
<p>to ﬁll me with wonder. I did not pretend to enter</p>
<p>into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards</p>
<p>the opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept,</p>
<p>without precisely understanding it.</p>
<p>“As I read, however, I applied much personally</p>
<p>to my own feelings and condition. I found myself</p>
<p>similar, yet at the same time strangely unlike the</p>
<p>beings concerning whom I read, and to whose con-</p>
<p>versation I was a listener. I sympathized with, and</p>
<p>partly understood them, but I was unformed in mind;</p>
<p>I was dependent on none, and related to none. ‘The</p>
<p>path of my departure was free;’ and there was none</p>
<p>to lament my annihilation. My person was hideous,</p>
<p>and my stature gigantic: what did this mean? Who</p>
<p>was I? What was I? Whence did I come? What</p>
<p>was my destination? These questions continually</p>
<p>recurred, but I was unable to solve them.</p>
<p>“The volume of Plutarch’s Lives which I pos-</p>
<p>sessed, contained the histories of the ﬁrst founders</p>
<p>of the ancient republics. This book had a far differ-</p>
<p>ent effect upon me from the Sorrows of Werter. I</p>
<p>learned from Werter’s imaginations despondency</p>
<p>and gloom: but Plutarch taught me high thoughts;</p>
<p>he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my</p>
<p>own reﬂections, to admire and love the heroes of</p>
<p>past ages. Many things I read surpassed my un-</p>
<p>derstanding and experience. I had a very confused</p>
<p>knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country,</p>
<p>mighty rivers, and boundless seas. But I was per-</p>
<p>fectly unacquainted with towns, and large assem-</p>
<p>blages of men. The cottage of my protectors had</p>
<p>been the only school in which I had studied human</p>
<p>nature; but this book developed new and mightier</p>
<p>scenes of action. I read of men concerned in public</p>
<p>affairs governing or massacring their species. I felt</p>
<p>the greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and</p>
<p>abhorrence for vice, as far as I understood the sig-</p>
<p>niﬁcation of those terms, relative as they were, as I</p>
<p>applied them, to pleasure and pain alone. Induced</p>
<p>by these feelings, I was of course led to admire</p>
<p>peaceable law-givers, Numa, Solon, and Lycurgus,</p>
<p>in preference to Romulus and Theseus. The patri-</p>
<p>archal lives of my protectors caused these impres-</p>
<p>sions to take a ﬁrm hold on my mind; perhaps, if</p>
<p>my ﬁrst introduction to humanity had been made by</p>
<p>a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I</p>
<p>should have been imbued with different sensations.</p>
<p>“But Paradise Lost excited different and far</p>
<p>deeper emotions. I read it, as I had read the other</p>
<p>volumes which had fallen into my hands, as a</p>
<p>true history. It moved every feeling of wonder and</p>
<p>awe, that the picture of an omnipotent God warring</p>
<p>with his creatures was capable of exciting. I often</p>
<p>referred the several situations, as their similarity</p>
<p>struck me, to my own. Like Adam, I was created</p>
<p>apparently united by no link to any other being in</p>
<p>existence; but his state was far different from mine</p>
<p>in every other respect. He had come forth from</p>
<p>the hands of God a perfect creature, happy and</p>
<p>prosperous, guarded by the especial care of his</p>
<p>Creator; he was allowed to converse with, and ac-</p>
<p>quire knowledge from beings of a superior nature:</p>
<p>but I was wretched, helpless, and alone. Many</p>
<p>times I considered Satan as the ﬁtter emblem of</p>
<p>my condition; for often, like him, when I viewed the</p>
<p>bliss of my protectors, the bitter gall of envy rose</p>
<p>within me.</p>
<p>“Another circumstance strengthened and con-</p>
<p>ﬁrmed these feelings. Soon after my arrival in the</p>
<p>hovel, I discovered some papers in the pocket of</p>
<p>the dress which I had taken from your laboratory.</p>
<p>At ﬁrst I had neglected them; but now that I was</p>
<p>able to decypher the characters in which they were</p>
<p>written, I began to study them with diligence. It was</p>
<p>your journal of the four months that preceded my</p>
<p>creation. You minutely described in these papers</p>
<p>every step you took in the progress of your work;</p>
<p>this history was mingled with accounts of domes-</p>
<p>tic occurrences. You, doubtless, recollect these</p>
<p>papers. Here they are. Every thing is related in</p>
<p>them which bears reference to my accursed ori-</p>
<p>gin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting</p>
<p>circumstances which produced it is set in view; the</p>
<p>minutest description of my odious and loathsome</p>
<p>person is given, in language which painted your</p>
<p>own horrors, and rendered mine ineffaceable. I</p>
<p>sickened as I read. ‘Hateful day when I received</p>
<p>life!’ I exclaimed in agony. ‘Cursed creator! Why did</p>
<p>you form a monster so hideous that even you turned</p>
<p>from me in disgust? God in pity made man beautiful</p>
<p>and alluring, after his own image; but my form is a</p>
<p>ﬁlthy type of your’s, more horrid from its very resem-</p>
<p>blance. Satan had his companions, fellow-devils, to</p>
<p>admire and encourage him; but I am solitary and</p>
<p>detested.’</p>
<p>“These were the reﬂections of my hours of</p>
<p>despondency and solitude; but when I contem-</p>
<p>plated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable</p>
<p>and benevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself</p>
<p>that when they should become acquainted with my</p>
<p>admiration of their virtues, they would compassion-</p>
<p>ate me, and overlook my personal deformity. Could</p>
<p>they turn from their door one, however monstrous,</p>
<p>who solicited their compassion and friendship? I</p>
<p>resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way</p>
<p>to ﬁt myself for an interview with them which would</p>
<p>decide my fate. I postponed this attempt for some</p>
<p>months longer; for the importance attached to its</p>
<p>success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail.</p>
<p>Besides, I found that my understanding improved</p>
<p>so much with every day’s experience, that I was</p>
<p>unwilling to commence this undertaking until a few</p>
<p>more months should have added to my wisdom.</p>
<p>“Several changes, in the mean time, took place</p>
<p>in the cottage. The presence of Saﬁe diffused hap-</p>
<p>piness among its inhabitants; and I also found that</p>
<p>a greater degree of plenty reigned there. Felix and</p>
<p>Agatha spent more time in amusement and con-</p>
<p>versation, and were assisted in their labours by</p>
<p>servants. They did not appear rich, but they were</p>
<p>contented and happy; their feelings were serene</p>
<p>and peaceful, while mine became every day more</p>
<p>tumultuous. Increase of knowledge only discovered</p>
<p>to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was.</p>
<p>I cherished hope, it is true; but it vanished, when I</p>
<p>beheld my person reﬂected in water, or my shadow</p>
<p>in the moon-shine, even as that frail image and that</p>
<p>inconstant shade.</p>
<p>“I endeavoured to crush these fears, and to</p>
<p>fortify myself for the trial which in a few months I</p>
<p>resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my</p>
<p>thoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the</p>
<p>ﬁelds of Paradise, and dared to fancy amiable and</p>
<p>lovely creatures sympathizing with my feelings and</p>
<p>cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances</p>
<p>breathed smiles of consolation. But it was all a</p>
<p>dream: no Eve soothed my sorrows, or shared</p>
<p>my thoughts; I was alone. I remembered Adam’s</p>
<p>supplication to his Creator; but where was mine?</p>
<p>he had abandoned me, and, in the bitterness of my</p>
<p>heart, I cursed him.</p>
<p>“Autumn passed thus. I saw, with surprise and</p>
<p>grief, the leaves decay and fall, and nature again</p>
<p>assume the barren and bleak appearance it had</p>
<p>worn when I ﬁrst beheld the woods and the lovely</p>
<p>moon. Yet I did not heed the bleakness of the</p>
<p>weather; I was better ﬁtted by my conformation for</p>
<p>the endurance of cold than heat. But my chief de-</p>
<p>lights were the sight of the ﬂowers, the birds, and all</p>
<p>the gay apparel of summer; when those deserted</p>
<p>me, I turned with more attention towards the cot-</p>
<p>tagers. Their happiness was not decreased by the</p>
<p>absence of summer. They loved, and sympathized</p>
<p>with one another; and their joys, depending on each</p>
<p>other, were not interrupted by the casualties that</p>
<p>took place around them. The more I saw of them,</p>
<p>the greater became my desire to claim their protec-</p>
<p>tion and kindness; my heart yearned to be known</p>
<p>and loved by these amiable creatures: to see their</p>
<p>sweet looks turned towards me with affection, was</p>
<p>the utmost limit of my ambition. I dared not think</p>
<p>that they would turn them from me with disdain and</p>
<p>horror. The poor that stopped at their door were</p>
<p>never driven away. I asked, it is true, for greater</p>
<p>treasures than a little food or rest; I required kind-</p>
<p>ness and sympathy; but I did not believe myself</p>
<p>utterly unworthy of it.</p>
<p>“The winter advanced, and an entire revolution</p>
<p>of the seasons had taken place since I awoke into</p>
<p>life. My attention, at this time, was solely directed</p>
<p>towards my plan of introducing myself into the cot-</p>
<p>tage of my protectors. I revolved many projects;</p>
<p>but that on which I ﬁnally ﬁxed was, to enter the</p>
<p>dwelling when the blind old man should be alone. I</p>
<p>had sagacity enough to discover, that the unnatu-</p>
<p>ral hideousness of my person was the chief object</p>
<p>of horror with those who had formerly beheld me.</p>
<p>My voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it;</p>
<p>I thought, therefore, that if, in the absence of his</p>
<p>children, I could gain the good-will and mediation of</p>
<p>the old De Lacy, I might, by his means, be tolerated</p>
<p>by my younger protectors.</p>
<p>“One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves</p>
<p>that strewed the ground, and diffused cheerfulness,</p>
<p>although it denied warmth, Saﬁe, Agatha, and Felix,</p>
<p>departed on a long country walk, and the old man,</p>
<p>at his own desire, was left alone in the cottage.</p>
<p>When his children had departed, he took up his</p>
<p>guitar, and played several mournful, but sweet airs,</p>
<p>more sweet and mournful than I had ever heard him</p>
<p>play before. At ﬁrst his countenance was illuminated</p>
<p>with pleasure, but, as he continued, thoughtfulness</p>
<p>and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the</p>
<p>instrument, he sat absorbed in reﬂection.</p>
<p>“My heart beat quick; this was the hour and</p>
<p>moment of trial, which would decide my hopes, or</p>
<p>realize my fears. The servants were gone to a</p>
<p>neighbouring fair. All was silent in and around the</p>
<p>cottage: it was an excellent opportunity; yet, when</p>
<p>I proceeded to execute my plan, my limbs failed</p>
<p>me, and I sunk to the ground. Again I rose; and,</p>
<p>exerting all the ﬁrmness of which I was master,</p>
<p>removed the planks which I had placed before my</p>
<p>hovel to conceal my retreat. The fresh air revived</p>
<p>me, and, with renewed determination, I approached</p>
<p>the door of their cottage.</p>
<p>“I knocked. ‘Who is there?’ said the old man —</p>
<p>‘Come in.’</p>
<p>“I entered; ‘Pardon this intrusion,’ said I, ‘I am</p>
<p>a traveller in want of a little rest; you would greatly</p>
<p>oblige me, if you would allow me to remain a few</p>
<p>minutes before the ﬁre.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Enter,’ said De Lacy; ‘and I will try in what</p>
<p>manner I can relieve your wants; but, unfortunately,</p>
<p>my children are from home, and, as I am blind, I am</p>
<p>afraid I shall ﬁnd it difﬁcult to procure food for you.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Do not trouble yourself, my kind host, I have</p>
<p>food; it is warmth and rest only that I need.’</p>
<p>“I sat down, and a silence ensued. I knew that</p>
<p>every minute was precious to me, yet I remained</p>
<p>irresolute in what manner to commence the inter-</p>
<p>view; when the old man addressed me —</p>
<p>“ ‘By your language, stranger, I suppose you are</p>
<p>my countryman; — are you French?’</p>
<p>“ ‘No; but I was educated by a French family,</p>
<p>and understand that language only. I am now going</p>
<p>to claim the protection of some friends, whom I</p>
<p>sincerely love, and of whose favour I have some</p>
<p>hopes.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Are these Germans?’</p>
<p>“ ‘No, they are French. But let us change the</p>
<p>subject. I am an unfortunate and deserted creature;</p>
<p>I look around, and I have no relation or friend upon</p>
<p>earth. These amiable people to whom I go have</p>
<p>never seen me, and know little of me. I am full of</p>
<p>fears; for if I fail there, I am an outcast in the world</p>
<p>for ever.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Do not despair. To be friendless is indeed</p>
<p>to be unfortunate; but the hearts of men, when</p>
<p>unprejudiced by any obvious self-interest, are full of</p>
<p>brotherly love and charity. Rely, therefore, on your</p>
<p>hopes; and if these friends are good and amiable,</p>
<p>do not despair.’</p>
<p>“ ‘They are kind — they are the most excellent</p>
<p>creatures in the world; but, unfortunately, they are</p>
<p>prejudiced against me. I have good dispositions;</p>
<p>my life has been hitherto harmless, and, in some</p>
<p>degree, beneﬁcial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their</p>
<p>eyes, and where they ought to see a feeling and</p>
<p>kind friend, they behold only a detestable monster.’</p>
<p>“ ‘That is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really</p>
<p>blameless, cannot you undeceive them?’</p>
<p>“ ‘I am about to undertake that task; and it is on</p>
<p>that account that I feel so many overwhelming ter-</p>
<p>rors. I tenderly love these friends; I have, unknown</p>
<p>to them, been for many months in the habits of daily</p>
<p>kindness towards them; but they believe that I wish</p>
<p>to injure them, and it is that prejudice which I wish</p>
<p>to overcome.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Where do these friends reside?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Near this spot.’</p>
<p>“The old man paused, and then continued, ‘If</p>
<p>you will unreservedly conﬁde to me the particulars</p>
<p>of your tale, I perhaps may be of use in undeceiving</p>
<p>them. I am blind, and cannot judge of your counte-</p>
<p>nance, but there is something in your words which</p>
<p>persuades me that you are sincere. I am poor, and</p>
<p>an exile; but it will afford me true pleasure to be in</p>
<p>any way serviceable to a human creature.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Excellent man! I thank you, and accept your</p>
<p>generous offer. You raise me from the dust by this</p>
<p>kindness; and I trust that, by your aid, I shall not</p>
<p>be driven from the society and sympathy of your</p>
<p>fellow-creatures.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Heaven forbid! even if you were really criminal;</p>
<p>for that can only drive you to desperation, and not</p>
<p>instigate you to virtue. I also am unfortunate; I</p>
<p>and my family have been condemned, although</p>
<p>innocent: judge, therefore, if I do not feel for your</p>
<p>misfortunes.’</p>
<p>“ ‘How can I thank you, my best and only bene-</p>
<p>factor? from your lips ﬁrst have I heard the voice</p>
<p>of kindness directed towards me; I shall be for ever</p>
<p>grateful; and your present humanity assures me of</p>
<p>success with those friends whom I am on the point</p>
<p>of meeting.’</p>
<p>“ ‘May I know the names and residence of those</p>
<p>friends?’</p>
<p>“I paused. This, I thought, was the moment</p>
<p>of decision, which was to rob me of, or bestow</p>
<p>happiness on me for ever. I struggled vainly for</p>
<p>ﬁrmness sufﬁcient to answer him, but the effort</p>
<p>destroyed all my remaining strength; I sank on the</p>
<p>chair, and sobbed aloud. At that moment I heard</p>
<p>the steps of my younger protectors. I had not a</p>
<p>moment to lose; but, seizing the hand of the old</p>
<p>man, I cried, ‘Now is the time! — save and protect</p>
<p>me! You and your family are the friends whom I</p>
<p>seek. Do not you desert me in the hour of trial!’</p>
<p>“ ‘Great God!’ exclaimed the old man, ‘who are</p>
<p>you?’</p>
<p>“At that instant the cottage door was opened,</p>
<p>and Felix, Saﬁe, and Agatha entered. Who can de-</p>
<p>scribe their horror and consternation on beholding</p>
<p>me? Agatha fainted; and Saﬁe, unable to attend to</p>
<p>her friend, rushed out of the cottage. Felix darted</p>
<p>forward, and with supernatural force tore me from</p>
<p>his father, to whose knees I clung: in a transport</p>
<p>of fury, he dashed me to the ground, and struck</p>
<p>me violently with a stick. I could have torn him limb</p>
<p>from limb, as the lion rends the antelope. But my</p>
<p>heart sunk within me as with bitter sickness, and I</p>
<p>refrained. I saw him on the point of repeating his</p>
<p>blow, when, overcome by pain and anguish, I quit-</p>
<p>ted the cottage, and in the general tumult escaped</p>
<p>unperceived to my hovel.”</p>
<p>Chapter VIII</p>
<p>“CURSED, cursed creator! Why did I live? Why,</p>
<p>in that instant, did I not extinguish the spark of</p>
<p>existence which you had so wantonly bestowed? I</p>
<p>know not; despair had not yet taken possession of</p>
<p>me; my feelings were those of rage and revenge. I</p>
<p>could with pleasure have destroyed the cottage and</p>
<p>its inhabitants, and have glutted myself with their</p>
<p>shrieks and misery.</p>
<p>“When night came, I quitted my retreat, and</p>
<p>wandered in the wood; and now, no longer re-</p>
<p>strained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my</p>
<p>anguish in fearful howlings. I was like a wild beast</p>
<p>238</p>
<p>that had broken the toils; destroying the objects</p>
<p>that obstructed me, and ranging through the wood</p>
<p>with a stag-like swiftness. Oh! what a miserable</p>
<p>night I passed! the cold stars shone in mockery,</p>
<p>and the bare trees waved their branches above me:</p>
<p>now and then the sweet voice of a bird burst forth</p>
<p>amidst the universal stillness. All, save I, were at</p>
<p>rest or in enjoyment: I, like the arch ﬁend, bore a</p>
<p>hell within me; and, ﬁnding myself unsympathized</p>
<p>with, wished to tear up the trees, spread havoc and</p>
<p>destruction around me, and then to have sat down</p>
<p>and enjoyed the ruin.</p>
<p>“But this was a luxury of sensation that could</p>
<p>not endure; I became fatigued with excess of bod-</p>
<p>ily exertion, and sank on the damp grass in the</p>
<p>sick impotence of despair. There was none among</p>
<p>the myriads of men that existed who would pity or</p>
<p>assist me; and should I feel kindness towards my</p>
<p>enemies? No: from that moment I declared ever-</p>
<p>lasting war against the species, and, more than all,</p>
<p>against him who had formed me, and sent me forth</p>
<p>to this insupportable misery.</p>
<p>“The sun rose; I heard the voices of men, and</p>
<p>knew that it was impossible to return to my retreat</p>
<p>during that day. Accordingly I hid myself in some</p>
<p>thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing</p>
<p>hours to reﬂection on my situation.</p>
<p>“The pleasant sunshine, and the pure air of day,</p>
<p>restored me to some degree of tranquillity; and</p>
<p>when I considered what had passed at the cottage,</p>
<p>I could not help believing that I had been too hasty</p>
<p>in my conclusions. I had certainly acted imprudently.</p>
<p>It was apparent that my conversation had interested</p>
<p>the father in my behalf, and I was a fool in having</p>
<p>exposed my person to the horror of his children. I</p>
<p>ought to have familiarized the old De Lacy to me,</p>
<p>and by degrees have discovered myself to the rest</p>
<p>of his family, when they should have been prepared</p>
<p>for my approach. But I did not believe my errors</p>
<p>to be irretrievable; and, after much consideration, I</p>
<p>resolved to return to the cottage, seek the old man,</p>
<p>and by my representations win him to my party.</p>
<p>“These thoughts calmed me, and in the after-</p>
<p>noon I sank into a profound sleep; but the fever of</p>
<p>my blood did not allow me to be visited by peace-</p>
<p>ful dreams. The horrible scene of the preceding</p>
<p>day was for ever acting before my eyes; the fe-</p>
<p>males were ﬂying, and the enraged Felix tearing</p>
<p>me from his father’s feet. I awoke exhausted; and,</p>
<p>ﬁnding that it was already night, I crept forth from</p>
<p>my hiding-place, and went in search of food.</p>
<p>“When my hunger was appeased, I directed my</p>
<p>steps towards the well-known path that conducted</p>
<p>to the cottage. All there was at peace. I crept into</p>
<p>my hovel, and remained in silent expectation of the</p>
<p>accustomed hour when the family arose. That hour</p>
<p>past, the sun mounted high in the heavens, but the</p>
<p>cottagers did not appear. I trembled violently, ap-</p>
<p>prehending some dreadful misfortune. The inside</p>
<p>of the cottage was dark, and I heard no motion; I</p>
<p>cannot describe the agony of this suspence.</p>
<p>“Presently two countrymen passed by; but,</p>
<p>pausing near the cottage, they entered into con-</p>
<p>versation, using violent gesticulations; but I did not</p>
<p>understand what they said, as they spoke the lan-</p>
<p>guage of the country, which differed from that of my</p>
<p>protectors. Soon after, however, Felix approached</p>
<p>with another man: I was surprised, as I knew that</p>
<p>he had not quitted the cottage that morning, and</p>
<p>waited anxiously to discover, from his discourse,</p>
<p>the meaning of these unusual appearances.</p>
<p>“ ‘Do you consider,’ said his companion to him,</p>
<p>‘that you will be obliged to pay three months’ rent,</p>
<p>and to lose the produce of your garden? I do not</p>
<p>wish to take any unfair advantage, and I beg there-</p>
<p>fore that you will take some days to consider of your</p>
<p>determination.’</p>
<p>“ ‘It is utterly useless,’ replied Felix, ‘we can</p>
<p>never again inhabit your cottage. The life of my</p>
<p>father is in the greatest danger, owing to the dread-</p>
<p>ful circumstance that I have related. My wife and my</p>
<p>sister will never recover their horror. I entreat you</p>
<p>not to reason with me any more. Take possession</p>
<p>of your tenement, and let me ﬂy from this place.’</p>
<p>“Felix trembled violently as he said this. He and</p>
<p>his companion entered the cottage, in which they</p>
<p>remained for a few minutes, and then departed. I</p>
<p>never saw any of the family of De Lacy more.</p>
<p>“I continued for the remainder of the day in my</p>
<p>hovel in a state of utter and stupid despair. My</p>
<p>protectors had departed, and had broken the only</p>
<p>link that held me to the world. For the ﬁrst time</p>
<p>the feelings of revenge and hatred ﬁlled my bosom,</p>
<p>and I did not strive to controul them; but, allowing</p>
<p>myself to be borne away by the stream, I bent my</p>
<p>mind towards injury and death. When I thought of</p>
<p>my friends, of the mild voice of De Lacy, the gentle</p>
<p>eyes of Agatha, and the exquisite beauty of the</p>
<p>Arabian, these thoughts vanished, and a gush of</p>
<p>tears somewhat soothed me. But again, when I</p>
<p>reﬂected that they had spurned and deserted me,</p>
<p>anger returned, a rage of anger; and, unable to</p>
<p>injure any thing human, I turned my fury towards</p>
<p>inanimate objects. As night advanced, I placed a</p>
<p>variety of combustibles around the cottage; and,</p>
<p>after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation</p>
<p>in the garden, I waited with forced impatience until</p>
<p>the moon had sunk to commence my operations.</p>
<p>“As the night advanced, a ﬁerce wind arose</p>
<p>from the woods, and quickly dispersed the clouds</p>
<p>that had loitered in the heavens: the blast tore along</p>
<p>like a mighty avalanche, and produced a kind of</p>
<p>insanity in my spirits, that burst all bounds of reason</p>
<p>and reﬂection. I lighted the dry branch of a tree,</p>
<p>and danced with fury around the devoted cottage,</p>
<p>my eyes still ﬁxed on the western horizon, the edge</p>
<p>of which the moon nearly touched. A part of its orb</p>
<p>was at length hid, and I waved my brand; it sunk,</p>
<p>and, with a loud scream, I ﬁred the straw, and heath,</p>
<p>and bushes, which I had collected. The wind fanned</p>
<p>the ﬁre, and the cottage was quickly enveloped by</p>
<p>the ﬂames, which clung to it, and licked it with their</p>
<p>forked and destroying tongues.</p>
<p>“As soon as I was convinced that no assistance</p>
<p>could save any part of the habitation, I quitted the</p>
<p>scene, and sought for refuge in the woods.</p>
<p>“And now, with the world before me, whither</p>
<p>should I bend my steps? I resolved to ﬂy far from</p>
<p>the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated and</p>
<p>despised, every country must be equally horrible.</p>
<p>At length the thought of you crossed my mind. I</p>
<p>learned from your papers that you were my father,</p>
<p>my creator; and to whom could I apply with more</p>
<p>ﬁtness than to him who had given me life? Among</p>
<p>the lessons that Felix had bestowed upon Saﬁe</p>
<p>geography had not been omitted: I had learned</p>
<p>from these the relative situations of the different</p>
<p>countries of the earth. You had mentioned Geneva</p>
<p>as the name of your native town; and towards this</p>
<p>place I resolved to proceed.</p>
<p>“But how was I to direct myself? I knew that I</p>
<p>must travel in a south-westerly direction to reach</p>
<p>my destination; but the sun was my only guide. I did</p>
<p>not know the names of the towns that I was to pass</p>
<p>through, nor could I ask information from a single</p>
<p>human being; but I did not despair. From you only</p>
<p>could I hope for succour, although towards you I felt</p>
<p>no sentiment but that of hatred. Unfeeling, heart-</p>
<p>less creator! you had endowed me with perceptions</p>
<p>and passions, and then cast me abroad an object</p>
<p>for the scorn and horror of mankind. But on you</p>
<p>only had I any claim for pity and redress, and from</p>
<p>you I determined to seek that justice which I vainly</p>
<p>attempted to gain from any other being that wore</p>
<p>the human form.</p>
<p>“My travels were long, and the sufferings I en-</p>
<p>dured intense. It was late in autumn when I quitted</p>
<p>the district where I had so long resided. I travelled</p>
<p>only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a</p>
<p>human being. Nature decayed around me, and the</p>
<p>sun became heatless; rain and snow poured around</p>
<p>me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface of the</p>
<p>earth was hard, and chill, and bare, and I found</p>
<p>no shelter. Oh, earth! how often did I imprecate</p>
<p>curses on the cause of my being! The mildness of</p>
<p>my nature had ﬂed, and all within me was turned</p>
<p>to gall and bitterness. The nearer I approached</p>
<p>to your habitation, the more deeply did I feel the</p>
<p>spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart. Snow fell,</p>
<p>and the waters were hardened, but I rested not.</p>
<p>A few incidents now and then directed me, and I</p>
<p>possessed a map of the country; but I often wan-</p>
<p>dered wide from my path. The agony of my feelings</p>
<p>allowed me no respite: no incident occurred from</p>
<p>which my rage and misery could not extract its food;</p>
<p>but a circumstance that happened when I arrived</p>
<p>on the conﬁnes of Switzerland, when the sun had</p>
<p>recovered its warmth, and the earth again began</p>
<p>to look green, conﬁrmed in an especial manner the</p>
<p>bitterness and horror of my feelings.</p>
<p>“I generally rested during the day, and travelled</p>
<p>only when I was secured by night from the view of</p>
<p>man. One morning, however, ﬁnding that my path</p>
<p>lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue</p>
<p>my journey after the sun had risen; the day, which</p>
<p>was one of the ﬁrst of spring, cheered even me by</p>
<p>the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess</p>
<p>of the air. I felt emotions of gentleness and plea-</p>
<p>sure, that had long appeared dead, revive within</p>
<p>me. Half surprised by the novelty of these sensa-</p>
<p>tions, I allowed myself to be borne away by them;</p>
<p>and, forgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to</p>
<p>be happy. Soft tears again bedewed my cheeks,</p>
<p>and I even raised my humid eyes with thankfulness</p>
<p>towards the blessed sun which bestowed such joy</p>
<p>upon me.</p>
<p>“I continued to wind among the paths of the</p>
<p>wood, until I came to its boundary, which was</p>
<p>skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many</p>
<p>of the trees bent their branches, now budding</p>
<p>with the fresh spring. Here I paused, not exactly</p>
<p>knowing what path to pursue, when I heard the</p>
<p>sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself</p>
<p>under the shade of a cypress. I was scarcely hid,</p>
<p>when a young girl came running towards the spot</p>
<p>where I was concealed, laughing as if she ran from</p>
<p>some one in sport. She continued her course along</p>
<p>the precipitous sides of the river, when suddenly</p>
<p>her foot slipt, and she fell into the rapid stream. I</p>
<p>rushed from my hiding place, and, with extreme</p>
<p>labour from the force of the current, saved her, and</p>
<p>dragged her to shore. She was senseless; and</p>
<p>I endeavoured, by every means in my power, to</p>
<p>restore animation, when I was suddenly interrupted</p>
<p>by the approach of a rustic, who was probably</p>
<p>the person from whom she had playfully ﬂed. On</p>
<p>seeing me, he darted towards me, and, tearing the</p>
<p>girl from my arms, hastened towards the deeper</p>
<p>parts of the wood. I followed speedily, I hardly</p>
<p>knew why; but when the man saw me draw near,</p>
<p>he aimed a gun, which he carried, at my body, and</p>
<p>ﬁred. I sunk to the ground, and my injurer, with</p>
<p>increased swiftness, escaped into the wood.</p>
<p>“This was then the reward of my benevolence!</p>
<p>I had saved a human being from destruction, and,</p>
<p>as a recompence, I now writhed under the miser-</p>
<p>able pain of a wound, which shattered the ﬂesh</p>
<p>and bone. The feelings of kindness and gentle-</p>
<p>ness, which I had entertained but a few moments</p>
<p>before, gave place to hellish rage and gnashing</p>
<p>of teeth. Inﬂamed by pain, I vowed eternal hatred</p>
<p>and vengeance to all mankind. But the agony of</p>
<p>my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I</p>
<p>fainted.</p>
<p>“For some weeks I led a miserable life in the</p>
<p>woods, endeavouring to cure the wound which I</p>
<p>had received. The ball had entered my shoulder,</p>
<p>and I knew not whether it had remained there or</p>
<p>passed through; at any rate I had no means of</p>
<p>extracting it. My sufferings were augmented also by</p>
<p>the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude</p>
<p>of their inﬂiction. My daily vows rose for revenge —</p>
<p>a deep and deadly revenge, such as would alone</p>
<p>compensate for the outrages and anguish I had</p>
<p>endured.</p>
<p>“After some weeks my wound healed, and I</p>
<p>continued my journey. The labours I endured were</p>
<p>no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or gentle</p>
<p>breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery, which</p>
<p>insulted my desolate state, and made me feel more</p>
<p>painfully that I was not made for the enjoyment of</p>
<p>pleasure.</p>
<p>“But my toils now drew near a close; and, two</p>
<p>months from this time, I reached the environs of</p>
<p>Geneva.</p>
<p>“It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to</p>
<p>a hiding-place among the ﬁelds that surround it, to</p>
<p>meditate in what manner I should apply to you. I</p>
<p>was oppressed by fatigue and hunger, and far too</p>
<p>unhappy to enjoy the gentle breezes of evening, or</p>
<p>the prospect of the sun setting behind the stupen-</p>
<p>dous mountains of Jura.</p>
<p>“At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the</p>
<p>pain of reﬂection, which was disturbed by the ap-</p>
<p>proach of a beautiful child, who came running into</p>
<p>the recess I had chosen with all the sportiveness</p>
<p>of infancy. Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea</p>
<p>seized me, that this little creature was unprejudiced,</p>
<p>and had lived too short a time to have imbibed a</p>
<p>horror of deformity. If, therefore, I could seize him,</p>
<p>and educate him as my companion and friend, I</p>
<p>should not be so desolate in this peopled earth.</p>
<p>“Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as</p>
<p>he passed, and drew him towards me. As soon as</p>
<p>he beheld my form, he placed his hands before his</p>
<p>eyes, and uttered a shrill scream: I drew his hand</p>
<p>forcibly from his face, and said, ‘Child, what is the</p>
<p>meaning of this? I do not intend to hurt you; listen</p>
<p>to me.’</p>
<p>“He struggled violently; ‘Let me go,’ he cried;</p>
<p>‘monster! ugly wretch! you wish to eat me, and tear</p>
<p>me to pieces — You are an ogre — Let me go, or I</p>
<p>will tell my papa.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Boy, you will never see your father again; you</p>
<p>must come with me.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Hideous monster! let me go; My papa is a</p>
<p>Syndic — he is M. Frankenstein — he would punish</p>
<p>you. You dare not keep me.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Frankenstein! you belong then to my enemy —</p>
<p>to him towards whom I have sworn eternal revenge;</p>
<p>you shall be my ﬁrst victim.’</p>
<p>“The child still struggled, and loaded me with ep-</p>
<p>ithets which carried despair to my heart: I grasped</p>
<p>his throat to silence him, and in a moment he lay</p>
<p>dead at my feet.</p>
<p>“I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled</p>
<p>with exultation and hellish triumph: clapping my</p>
<p>hands, I exclaimed, ‘I, too, can create desolation;</p>
<p>my enemy is not impregnable; this death will carry</p>
<p>despair to him, and a thousand other miseries shall</p>
<p>torment and destroy him.’</p>
<p>“As I ﬁxed my eyes on the child, I saw something</p>
<p>glittering on his breast. I took it; it was a portrait</p>
<p>of a most lovely woman. In spite of my malignity, it</p>
<p>softened and attracted me. For a few moments I</p>
<p>gazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep</p>
<p>lashes, and her lovely lips; but presently my rage</p>
<p>returned: I remembered that I was for ever deprived</p>
<p>of the delights that such beautiful creatures could</p>
<p>bestow; and that she whose resemblance I contem-</p>
<p>plated would, in regarding me, have changed that</p>
<p>air of divine benignity to one expressive of disgust</p>
<p>and affright.</p>
<p>“Can you wonder that such thoughts trans-</p>
<p>ported me with rage? I only wonder that at that</p>
<p>moment, instead of venting my sensations in excla-</p>
<p>mations and agony, I did not rush among mankind,</p>
<p>and perish in the attempt to destroy them.</p>
<p>“While I was overcome by these feelings, I left</p>
<p>the spot where I had committed the murder, and</p>
<p>was seeking a more secluded hiding-place, when</p>
<p>I perceived a woman passing near me. She was</p>
<p>young, not indeed so beautiful as her whose portrait</p>
<p>I held, but of an agreeable aspect, and blooming in</p>
<p>the loveliness of youth and health. Here, I thought,</p>
<p>is one of those whose smiles are bestowed on all</p>
<p>but me; she shall not escape: thanks to the lessons</p>
<p>of Felix, and the sanguinary laws of man, I have</p>
<p>learned how to work mischief. I approached her</p>
<p>unperceived, and placed the portrait securely in</p>
<p>one of the folds of her dress.</p>
<p>“For some days I haunted the spot where these</p>
<p>scenes had taken place; sometimes wishing to see</p>
<p>you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and its</p>
<p>miseries for ever. At length I wandered towards</p>
<p>these mountains, and have ranged through their im-</p>
<p>mense recesses, consumed by a burning passion</p>
<p>which you alone can gratify. We may not part until</p>
<p>you have promised to comply with my requisition.</p>
<p>I am alone, and miserable; man will not associate</p>
<p>with me; but one as deformed and horrible as my-</p>
<p>self would not deny herself to me. My companion</p>
<p>must be of the same species, and have the same</p>
<p>defects. This being you must create.”</p>
<p>Chapter IX</p>
<p>THE being ﬁnished speaking, and ﬁxed his looks</p>
<p>upon me in expectation of a reply. But I was bewil-</p>
<p>dered, perplexed, and unable to arrange my ideas</p>
<p>sufﬁciently to understand the full extent of his propo-</p>
<p>sition. He continued —</p>
<p>“You must create a female for me, with whom</p>
<p>I can live in the interchange of those sympathies</p>
<p>necessary for my being. This you alone can do;</p>
<p>and I demand it of you as a right which you must</p>
<p>not refuse.”</p>
<p>The latter part of his tale had kindled anew in</p>
<p>me the anger that had died away while he narrated</p>
<p>255</p>
<p>his peaceful life among the cottagers, and, as he</p>
<p>said this, I could no longer suppress the rage that</p>
<p>burned within me.</p>
<p>“I do refuse it,” I replied; “and no torture shall</p>
<p>ever extort a consent from me. You may render</p>
<p>me the most miserable of men, but you shall never</p>
<p>make me base in my own eyes. Shall I create</p>
<p>another like yourself, whose joint wickedness might</p>
<p>desolate the world. Begone! I have answered you;</p>
<p>you may torture me, but I will never consent.”</p>
<p>“You are in the wrong,” replied the ﬁend; “and,</p>
<p>instead of threatening, I am content to reason with</p>
<p>you. I am malicious because I am miserable; am</p>
<p>I not shunned and hated by all mankind? You, my</p>
<p>creator, would tear me to pieces, and triumph; re-</p>
<p>member that, and tell me why I should pity man</p>
<p>more than he pities me? You would not call it mur-</p>
<p>der, if you could precipitate me into one of those</p>
<p>ice-rifts, and destroy my frame, the work of your</p>
<p>own hands. Shall I respect man, when he con-</p>
<p>temns me? Let him live with me in the interchange</p>
<p>of kindness, and, instead of injury, I would bestow</p>
<p>every beneﬁt upon him with tears of gratitude at his</p>
<p>acceptance. But that cannot be; the human senses</p>
<p>are insurmountable barriers to our union. Yet mine</p>
<p>shall not be the submission of abject slavery. I will</p>
<p>revenge my injuries: if I cannot inspire love, I will</p>
<p>cause fear; and chieﬂy towards you my arch-enemy,</p>
<p>because my creator, do I swear inextinguishable ha-</p>
<p>tred. Have a care: I will work at your destruction,</p>
<p>nor ﬁnish until I desolate your heart, so that you</p>
<p>curse the hour of your birth.”</p>
<p>A ﬁendish rage animated him as he said this;</p>
<p>his face was wrinkled into contortions too horrible</p>
<p>for human eyes to behold; but presently he calmed</p>
<p>himself, and proceeded —</p>
<p>“I intended to reason. This passion is detrimen-</p>
<p>tal to me; for you do not reﬂect that you are the</p>
<p>cause of its excess. If any being felt emotions of</p>
<p>benevolence towards me, I should return them an</p>
<p>hundred and an hundred fold; for that one crea-</p>
<p>ture’s sake, I would make peace with the whole</p>
<p>kind! But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that can-</p>
<p>not be realized. What I ask of you is reasonable</p>
<p>and moderate; I demand a creature of another sex,</p>
<p>but as hideous as myself: the gratiﬁcation is small,</p>
<p>but it is all that I can receive, and it shall content</p>
<p>me. It is true, we shall be monsters, cut off from</p>
<p>all the world; but on that account we shall be more</p>
<p>attached to one another. Our lives will not be happy,</p>
<p>but they will be harmless, and free from the misery</p>
<p>I now feel. Oh! my creator, make me happy; let</p>
<p>me feel gratitude towards you for one beneﬁt! Let</p>
<p>me see that I excite the sympathy of some existing</p>
<p>thing; do not deny me my request!”</p>
<p>I was moved. I shuddered when I thought of the</p>
<p>possible consequences of my consent; but I felt that</p>
<p>there was some justice in his argument. His tale,</p>
<p>and the feelings he now expressed, proved him to</p>
<p>be a creature of ﬁne sensations; and did I not, as</p>
<p>his maker, owe him all the portion of happiness that</p>
<p>it was in my power to bestow? He saw my change</p>
<p>of feeling, and continued —</p>
<p>“If you consent, neither you nor any other hu-</p>
<p>man being shall ever see us again: I will go to the</p>
<p>vast wilds of South America. My food is not that of</p>
<p>man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid, to glut</p>
<p>my appetite; acorns and berries afford me sufﬁcient</p>
<p>nourishment. My companion will be of the same</p>
<p>nature as myself, and will be content with the same</p>
<p>fare. We shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun</p>
<p>will shine on us as on man, and will ripen our food.</p>
<p>The picture I present to you is peaceful and human,</p>
<p>and you must feel that you could deny it only in the</p>
<p>wantonness of power and cruelty. Pitiless as you</p>
<p>have been towards me, I now see compassion in</p>
<p>your eyes: let me seize the favourable moment, and</p>
<p>persuade you to promise what I so ardently desire.”</p>
<p>“You propose,” replied I, “to ﬂy from the habi-</p>
<p>tations of man, to dwell in those wilds where the</p>
<p>beasts of the ﬁeld will be your only companions.</p>
<p>How can you, who long for the love and sympathy</p>
<p>of man, persevere in this exile? You will return, and</p>
<p>again seek their kindness, and you will meet with</p>
<p>their detestation; your evil passions will be renewed,</p>
<p>and you will then have a companion to aid you in</p>
<p>the task of destruction. This may not be; cease to</p>
<p>argue the point, for I cannot consent.”</p>
<p>“How inconstant are your feelings! but a mo-</p>
<p>ment ago you were moved by my representations,</p>
<p>and why do you again harden yourself to my com-</p>
<p>plaints? I swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit,</p>
<p>and by you that made me, that, with the companion</p>
<p>you bestow, I will quit the neighbourhood of man,</p>
<p>and dwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of</p>
<p>places. My evil passions will have ﬂed, for I shall</p>
<p>meet with sympathy; my life will ﬂow quietly away,</p>
<p>and, in my dying moments, I shall not curse my</p>
<p>maker.”</p>
<p>His words had a strange effect upon me. I com-</p>
<p>passionated him, and sometimes felt a wish to con-</p>
<p>sole him; but when I looked upon him, when I saw</p>
<p>the ﬁlthy mass that moved and talked, my heart</p>
<p>sickened, and my feelings were altered to those of</p>
<p>horror and hatred. I tried to stiﬂe these sensations;</p>
<p>I thought, that as I could not sympathize with him, I</p>
<p>had no right to withhold from him the small portion</p>
<p>of happiness which was yet in my power to bestow.</p>
<p>“You swear,” I said, “to be harmless; but have</p>
<p>you not already shewn a degree of malice that</p>
<p>should reasonably make me distrust you? May not</p>
<p>even this be a feint that will increase your triumph</p>
<p>by affording a wider scope for your revenge?”</p>
<p>“How is this? I thought I had moved your com-</p>
<p>passion, and yet you still refuse to bestow on me</p>
<p>the only beneﬁt that can soften my heart, and ren-</p>
<p>der me harmless. If I have no ties and no affections,</p>
<p>hatred and vice must be my portion; the love of</p>
<p>another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and</p>
<p>I shall become a thing, of whose existence every</p>
<p>one will be ignorant. My vices are the children of</p>
<p>a forced solitude that I abhor; and my virtues will</p>
<p>necessarily arise when I live in communion with an</p>
<p>equal. I shall feel the affections of a sensitive being,</p>
<p>and become linked to the chain of existence and</p>
<p>events, from which I am now excluded.”</p>
<p>I paused some time to reﬂect on all he had</p>
<p>related, and the various arguments which he had</p>
<p>employed. I thought of the promise of virtues which</p>
<p>he had displayed on the opening of his existence,</p>
<p>and the subsequent blight of all kindly feeling by</p>
<p>the loathing and scorn which his protectors had</p>
<p>manifested towards him. His power and threats</p>
<p>were not omitted in my calculations: a creature</p>
<p>who could exist in the ice caves of the glaciers,</p>
<p>and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of</p>
<p>inaccessible precipices, was a being possessing</p>
<p>faculties it would be vain to cope with. After a long</p>
<p>pause of reﬂection, I concluded, that the justice due</p>
<p>both to him and my fellow-creatures demanded of</p>
<p>me that I should comply with his request. Turning</p>
<p>to him, therefore, I said —</p>
<p>“I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath</p>
<p>to quit Europe for ever, and every other place in the</p>
<p>neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shall deliver</p>
<p>into your hands a female who will accompany you</p>
<p>in your exile.”</p>
<p>“I swear,” he cried, “by the sun, and by the blue</p>
<p>sky of heaven, that if you grant my prayer, while</p>
<p>they exist you shall never behold me again. Depart</p>
<p>to your home, and commence your labours: I shall</p>
<p>watch their progress with unutterable anxiety; and</p>
<p>fear not but that when you are ready I shall appear.”</p>
<p>Saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful,</p>
<p>perhaps, of any change in my sentiments. I saw</p>
<p>him descend the mountain with greater speed than</p>
<p>the ﬂight of an eagle, and quickly lost him among</p>
<p>the undulations of the sea of ice.</p>
<p>His tale had occupied the whole day; and the</p>
<p>sun was upon the verge of the horizon when he</p>
<p>departed. I knew that I ought to hasten my descent</p>
<p>towards the valley, as I should soon be encom-</p>
<p>passed in darkness; but my heart was heavy, and</p>
<p>my steps slow. The labour of winding among the lit-</p>
<p>tle paths of the mountains, and ﬁxing my feet ﬁrmly</p>
<p>as I advanced, perplexed me, occupied as I was by</p>
<p>the emotions which the occurrences of the day had</p>
<p>produced. Night was far advanced, when I came to</p>
<p>the half-way resting-place, and seated myself be-</p>
<p>side the fountain. The stars shone at intervals, as</p>
<p>the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines</p>
<p>rose before me, and every here and there a broken</p>
<p>tree lay on the ground: it was a scene of wonderful</p>
<p>solemnity, and stirred strange thoughts within me.</p>
<p>I wept bitterly; and, clasping my hands in agony, I</p>
<p>exclaimed, “Oh! stars, and clouds, and winds, ye</p>
<p>are all about to mock me: if ye really pity me, crush</p>
<p>sensation and memory; let me become as nought;</p>
<p>but if not, depart, depart and leave me in darkness.”</p>
<p>These were wild and miserable thoughts; but I</p>
<p>cannot describe to you how the eternal twinkling of</p>
<p>the stars weighed upon me, and how I listened to</p>
<p>every blast of wind, as if it were a dull ugly siroc on</p>
<p>its way to consume me.</p>
<p>Morning dawned before I arrived at the village</p>
<p>of Chamounix; but my presence, so haggard and</p>
<p>strange, hardly calmed the fears of my family, who</p>
<p>had waited the whole night in anxious expectation</p>
<p>of my return.</p>
<p>The following day we returned to Geneva. The</p>
<p>intention of my father in coming had been to divert</p>
<p>my mind, and to restore me to my lost tranquillity;</p>
<p>but the medicine had been fatal. And, unable to</p>
<p>account for the excess of misery I appeared to</p>
<p>suffer, he hastened to return home, hoping the quiet</p>
<p>and monotony of a domestic life would by degrees</p>
<p>alleviate my sufferings from whatsoever cause they</p>
<p>might spring.</p>
<p>For myself, I was passive in all their arrange-</p>
<p>ments; and the gentle affection of my beloved Eliza-</p>
<p>beth was inadequate to draw me from the depth of</p>
<p>my despair. The promise I had made to the dæmon</p>
<p>weighed upon my mind, like Dante’s iron cowl on</p>
<p>the heads of the hellish hypocrites. All pleasures</p>
<p>of earth and sky passed before me like a dream,</p>
<p>and that thought only had to me the reality of life.</p>
<p>Can you wonder, that sometimes a kind of insanity</p>
<p>possessed me, or that I saw continually about me</p>
<p>a multitude of ﬁlthy animals inﬂicting on me inces-</p>
<p>sant torture, that often extorted screams and bitter</p>
<p>groans?</p>
<p>By degrees, however, these feelings became</p>
<p>calmed. I entered again into the every-day scene</p>
<p>of life, if not with interest, at least with some degree</p>
<p>of tranquillity.</p>
<p>Volume III</p>
<p>266</p>
<p>Chapter I</p>
<p>DAY after day, week after week, passed away on</p>
<p>my return to Geneva; and I could not collect the</p>
<p>courage to recommence my work. I feared the</p>
<p>vengeance of the disappointed ﬁend, yet I was un-</p>
<p>able to overcome my repugnance to the task which</p>
<p>was enjoined me. I found that I could not compose</p>
<p>a female without again devoting several months</p>
<p>to profound study and laborious disquisition. I had</p>
<p>heard of some discoveries having been made by an</p>
<p>English philosopher, the knowledge of which was</p>
<p>material to my success, and I sometimes thought</p>
<p>of obtaining my father’s consent to visit England</p>
<p>267</p>
<p>for this purpose; but I clung to every pretence of</p>
<p>delay, and could not resolve to interrupt my return-</p>
<p>ing tranquillity. My health, which had hitherto de-</p>
<p>clined, was now much restored; and my spirits,</p>
<p>when unchecked by the memory of my unhappy</p>
<p>promise, rose proportionably. My father saw this</p>
<p>change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts</p>
<p>towards the best method of eradicating the remains</p>
<p>of my melancholy, which every now and then would</p>
<p>return by ﬁts, and with a devouring blackness over-</p>
<p>cast the approaching sunshine. At these moments</p>
<p>I took refuge in the most perfect solitude. I passed</p>
<p>whole days on the lake alone in a little boat, watch-</p>
<p>ing the clouds, and listening to the rippling of the</p>
<p>waves, silent and listless. But the fresh air and</p>
<p>bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some de-</p>
<p>gree of composure; and, on my return, I met the</p>
<p>salutations of my friends with a readier smile and a</p>
<p>more cheerful heart.</p>
<p>It was after my return from one of these rambles</p>
<p>that my father, calling me aside, thus addressed</p>
<p>me:—</p>
<p>“I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you</p>
<p>have resumed your former pleasures, and seem</p>
<p>to be returning to yourself. And yet you are still</p>
<p>unhappy, and still avoid our society. For some time</p>
<p>I was lost in conjecture as to the cause of this;</p>
<p>but yesterday an idea struck me, and if it is well</p>
<p>founded, I conjure you to avow it. Reserve on such</p>
<p>a point would be not only useless, but draw down</p>
<p>treble misery on us all.”</p>
<p>I trembled violently at this exordium, and my</p>
<p>father continued —</p>
<p>“I confess, my son, that I have always looked</p>
<p>forward to your marriage with your cousin as the</p>
<p>tie of our domestic comfort, and the stay of my</p>
<p>declining years. You were attached to each other</p>
<p>from your earliest infancy; you studied together, and</p>
<p>appeared, in dispositions and tastes, entirely suited</p>
<p>to one another. But so blind is the experience of</p>
<p>man, that what I conceived to be the best assistants</p>
<p>to my plan may have entirely destroyed it. You,</p>
<p>perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any wish</p>
<p>that she might become your wife. Nay, you may</p>
<p>have met with another whom you may love; and,</p>
<p>considering yourself as bound in honour to your</p>
<p>cousin, this struggle may occasion the poignant</p>
<p>misery which you appear to feel.”</p>
<p>“My dear father, re-assure yourself. I love</p>
<p>my cousin tenderly and sincerely. I never saw</p>
<p>any woman who excited, as Elizabeth does, my</p>
<p>warmest admiration and affection. My future hopes</p>
<p>and prospects are entirely bound up in the expecta-</p>
<p>tion of our union.”</p>
<p>“The expression of your sentiments on this sub-</p>
<p>ject, my dear Victor, gives me more pleasure than I</p>
<p>have for some time experienced. If you feel thus, we</p>
<p>shall assuredly be happy, however present events</p>
<p>may cast a gloom over us. But it is this gloom, which</p>
<p>appears to have taken so strong a hold of your</p>
<p>mind, that I wish to dissipate. Tell me, therefore,</p>
<p>whether you object to an immediate solemnization</p>
<p>of the marriage. We have been unfortunate, and</p>
<p>recent events have drawn us from that every-day</p>
<p>tranquillity beﬁtting my years and inﬁrmities. You</p>
<p>are younger; yet I do not suppose, possessed as</p>
<p>you are of a competent fortune, that an early mar-</p>
<p>riage would at all interfere with any future plans of</p>
<p>honour and utility that you may have formed. Do not</p>
<p>suppose, however, that I wish to dictate happiness</p>
<p>to you, or that a delay on your part would cause</p>
<p>me any serious uneasiness. Interpret my words</p>
<p>with candour, and answer me, I conjure you, with</p>
<p>conﬁdence and sincerity.”</p>
<p>I listened to my father in silence, and remained</p>
<p>for some time incapable of offering any reply. I re-</p>
<p>volved rapidly in my mind a multitude of thoughts,</p>
<p>and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion.</p>
<p>Alas! to me the idea of an immediate union with my</p>
<p>cousin was one of horror and dismay. I was bound</p>
<p>by a solemn promise, which I had not yet fulﬁlled,</p>
<p>and dared not break; or, if I did, what manifold mis-</p>
<p>eries might not impend over me and my devoted</p>
<p>family! Could I enter into a festival with this deadly</p>
<p>weight yet hanging round my neck, and bowing me</p>
<p>to the ground. I must perform my engagement, and</p>
<p>let the monster depart with his mate, before I al-</p>
<p>lowed myself to enjoy the delight of an union from</p>
<p>which I expected peace.</p>
<p>I remembered also the necessity imposed upon</p>
<p>me of either journeying to England, or entering</p>
<p>into a long correspondence with those philosophers</p>
<p>of that country, whose knowledge and discoveries</p>
<p>were of indispensable use to me in my present</p>
<p>undertaking. The latter method of obtaining the</p>
<p>desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory:</p>
<p>besides, any variation was agreeable to me, and</p>
<p>I was delighted with the idea of spending a year</p>
<p>or two in change of scene and variety of occupa-</p>
<p>tion, in absence from my family; during which pe-</p>
<p>riod some event might happen which would restore</p>
<p>me to them in peace and happiness: my promise</p>
<p>might be fulﬁlled, and the monster have departed;</p>
<p>or some accident might occur to destroy him, and</p>
<p>put an end to my slavery for ever.</p>
<p>These feelings dictated my answer to my father.</p>
<p>I expressed a wish to visit England; but, concealing</p>
<p>the true reasons of this request, I clothed my de-</p>
<p>sires under the guise of wishing to travel and see</p>
<p>the world before I sat down for life within the walls</p>
<p>of my native town.</p>
<p>I urged my entreaty with earnestness, and my</p>
<p>father was easily induced to comply; for a more</p>
<p>indulgent and less dictatorial parent did not exist</p>
<p>upon earth. Our plan was soon arranged. I should</p>
<p>travel to Strasburgh, where Clerval would join me.</p>
<p>Some short time would be spent in the towns of</p>
<p>Holland, and our principal stay would be in England.</p>
<p>We should return by France; and it was agreed that</p>
<p>the tour should occupy the space of two years.</p>
<p>My father pleased himself with the reﬂection,</p>
<p>that my union with Elizabeth should take place im-</p>
<p>mediately on my return to Geneva. “These two</p>
<p>years,” said be, “will pass swiftly, and it will be the</p>
<p>last delay that will oppose itself to your happiness.</p>
<p>And, indeed, I earnestly desire that period to arrive,</p>
<p>when we shall all be united, and neither hopes or</p>
<p>fears arise to disturb our domestic calm.”</p>
<p>“I am content,” I replied, “with your arrangement.</p>
<p>By that time we shall both have become wiser, and</p>
<p>I hope happier, than we at present are.” I sighed;</p>
<p>but my father kindly forbore to question me further</p>
<p>concerning the cause of my dejection. He hoped</p>
<p>that new scenes, and the amusement of travelling,</p>
<p>would restore my tranquillity.</p>
<p>I now made arrangements for my journey; but</p>
<p>one feeling haunted me, which ﬁlled me with fear</p>
<p>and agitation. During my absence I should leave my</p>
<p>friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy,</p>
<p>and unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as</p>
<p>he might be by my departure. But he had promised</p>
<p>to follow me wherever I might go; and would he not</p>
<p>accompany me to England? This imagination was</p>
<p>dreadful in itself, but soothing, inasmuch as it sup-</p>
<p>posed the safety of my friends. I was agonized with</p>
<p>the idea of the possibility that the reverse of this</p>
<p>might happen. But through the whole period during</p>
<p>which I was the slave of my creature, I allowed my-</p>
<p>self to be governed by the impulses of the moment;</p>
<p>and my present sensations strongly intimated that</p>
<p>the ﬁend would follow me, and exempt my family</p>
<p>from the danger of his machinations.</p>
<p>It was in the latter end of August that I departed,</p>
<p>to pass two years of exile. Elizabeth approved of the</p>
<p>reasons of my departure, and only regretted that</p>
<p>she had not the same opportunities of enlarging</p>
<p>her experience, and cultivating her understanding.</p>
<p>She wept, however, as she bade me farewell, and</p>
<p>entreated me to return happy and tranquil. “We</p>
<p>all,” said she, “depend upon you; and if you are</p>
<p>miserable, what must be our feelings?”</p>
<p>I threw myself into the carriage that was to con-</p>
<p>vey me away, hardly knowing whither I was going,</p>
<p>and careless of what was passing around. I re-</p>
<p>membered only, and it was with a bitter anguish</p>
<p>that I reﬂected on it, to order that my chemical in-</p>
<p>struments should be packed to go with me: for</p>
<p>I resolved to fulﬁl my promise while abroad, and</p>
<p>return, if possible, a free man. Filled with dreary</p>
<p>imaginations, I passed through many beautiful and</p>
<p>majestic scenes; but my eyes were ﬁxed and un-</p>
<p>observing. I could only think of the bourne of my</p>
<p>travels, and the work which was to occupy me whilst</p>
<p>they endured.</p>
<p>After some days spent in listless indolence, dur-</p>
<p>ing which I traversed many leagues, I arrived at</p>
<p>Strasburgh, where I waited two days for Clerval. He</p>
<p>came. Alas, how great was the contrast between</p>
<p>us! He was alive to every new scene; joyful when</p>
<p>he saw the beauties of the setting sun, and more</p>
<p>happy when he beheld it rise, and recommence a</p>
<p>new day. He pointed out to me the shifting colours</p>
<p>of the landscape, and the appearances of the sky.</p>
<p>“This is what it is to live;” he cried, “now I enjoy exis-</p>
<p>tence! But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore</p>
<p>are you desponding and sorrowful?” In truth, I was</p>
<p>occupied by gloomy thoughts, and neither saw the</p>
<p>descent of the evening star, nor the golden sun-rise</p>
<p>reﬂected in the Rhine. — And you, my friend, would</p>
<p>be far more amused with the journal of Clerval, who</p>
<p>observed the scenery with an eye of feeling and</p>
<p>delight, than to listen to my reﬂections. I, a miser-</p>
<p>able wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every</p>
<p>avenue to enjoyment.</p>
<p>We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat</p>
<p>from Strasburgh to Rotterdam, whence we might</p>
<p>take shipping for London. During this voyage, we</p>
<p>passed by many willowy islands, and saw several</p>
<p>beautiful towns. We staid a day at Manheim, and,</p>
<p>on the ﬁfth from our departure from Strasburgh, ar-</p>
<p>rived at Mayence. The course of the Rhine below</p>
<p>Mayence becomes much more picturesque. The</p>
<p>river descends rapidly, and winds between hills,</p>
<p>not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms. We</p>
<p>saw many ruined castles standing on the edges of</p>
<p>precipices, surrounded by black woods, high and in-</p>
<p>accessible. This part of the Rhine, indeed, presents</p>
<p>a singularly variegated landscape. In one spot</p>
<p>you view rugged hills, ruined castles overlooking</p>
<p>tremendous precipices, with the dark Rhine rushing</p>
<p>beneath; and, on the sudden turn of a promontory,</p>
<p>ﬂourishing vineyards, with green sloping banks, and</p>
<p>a meandering river, and populous towns, occupy</p>
<p>the scene.</p>
<p>We travelled at the time of the vintage, and</p>
<p>heard the song of the labourers, as we glided down</p>
<p>the stream. Even I, depressed in mind, and my</p>
<p>spirits continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even</p>
<p>I was pleased. I lay at the bottom of the boat, and,</p>
<p>as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to</p>
<p>drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a</p>
<p>stranger. And if these were my sensations, who</p>
<p>can describe those of Henry? He felt as if he had</p>
<p>been transported to Fairy-land, and enjoyed a hap-</p>
<p>piness seldom tasted by man. “I have seen,” he</p>
<p>said, “the most beautiful scenes of my own country;</p>
<p>I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where</p>
<p>the snowy mountains descend almost perpendicu-</p>
<p>larly to the water, casting black and impenetrable</p>
<p>shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful</p>
<p>appearance, were it not for the most verdant is-</p>
<p>lands that relieve the eye by their gay appearance; I</p>
<p>have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the</p>
<p>wind tore up whirlwinds of water, and gave you an</p>
<p>idea of what the water-spout must be on the great</p>
<p>ocean, and the waves dash with fury the base of the</p>
<p>mountain, where the priest and his mistress were</p>
<p>overwhelmed by an avalanche, and where their dy-</p>
<p>ing voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses</p>
<p>of the nightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La</p>
<p>Valais, and the Pays de Vaud: but this country, Vic-</p>
<p>tor, pleases me more than all those wonders. The</p>
<p>mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and</p>
<p>strange; but there is a charm in the banks of this di-</p>
<p>vine river, that I never before saw equalled. Look at</p>
<p>that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that</p>
<p>also on the island, almost concealed amongst the</p>
<p>foliage of those lovely trees; and now that group of</p>
<p>labourers coming from among their vines; and that</p>
<p>village half-hid in the recess of the mountain. Oh,</p>
<p>surely, the spirit that inhabits and guards this place</p>
<p>has a soul more in harmony with man, than those</p>
<p>who pile the glacier, or retire to the inaccessible</p>
<p>peaks of the mountains of our own country.”</p>
<p>Clerval! beloved friend! even now it delights</p>
<p>me to record your words, and to dwell on the praise</p>
<p>of which you are so eminently deserving. He was</p>
<p>a being formed in the “very poetry of nature.” His</p>
<p>wild and enthusiastic imagination was chastened</p>
<p>by the sensibility of his heart. His soul overﬂowed</p>
<p>with ardent affections, and his friendship was of</p>
<p>that devoted and wondrous nature that the worldly-</p>
<p>minded teach us to look for only in the imagination.</p>
<p>But even human sympathies were not sufﬁcient to</p>
<p>satisfy his eager mind. The scenery of external</p>
<p>nature, which others regard only with admiration,</p>
<p>he loved with ardour:</p>
<p>—— —— “The sounding cataract</p>
<p>Haunted him like a passion: the tall rock,</p>
<p>The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,</p>
<p>Their colours and their forms, were then to him</p>
<p>An appetite; a feeling, and a love,</p>
<p>That had no need of a remoter charm,</p>
<p>By thought supplied, or any interest</p>
<p>Unborrowed from the eye.”</p>
<p>And where does he now exist? Is this gentle</p>
<p>and lovely being lost for ever? Has this mind so</p>
<p>replete with ideas, imaginations fanciful and mag-</p>
<p>niﬁcent, which formed a world, whose existence</p>
<p>depended on the life of its creator; has this mind</p>
<p>perished? Does it now only exist in my memory?</p>
<p>No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and</p>
<p>beaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit</p>
<p>still visits and consoles your unhappy friend.</p>
<p>Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual</p>
<p>words are but a slight tribute to the unexampled</p>
<p>worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart, over-</p>
<p>ﬂowing with the anguish which his remembrance</p>
<p>creates. I will proceed with my tale.</p>
<p>Beyond Cologne we descended to the plains of</p>
<p>Holland; and we resolved to post the remainder of</p>
<p>our way; for the wind was contrary, and the stream</p>
<p>of the river was too gentle to aid us.</p>
<p>Our journey here lost the interest arising from</p>
<p>beautiful scenery; but we arrived in a few days</p>
<p>at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to</p>
<p>England. It was on a clear morning, in the latter</p>
<p>days of December, that I ﬁrst saw the white cliffs</p>
<p>of Britain. The banks of the Thames presented a</p>
<p>new scene; they were ﬂat, but fertile, and almost</p>
<p>every town was marked by the remembrance of</p>
<p>some story. We saw Tilbury Fort, and remembered</p>
<p>the Spanish armada; Gravesend, Woolwich, and</p>
<p>Greenwich, places which I had heard of even in my</p>
<p>country.</p>
<p>At length we saw the numerous steeples of Lon-</p>
<p>don, St. Paul’s towering above all, and the Tower</p>
<p>famed in English history.</p>
<p>Chapter II</p>
<p>LONDON was our present point of rest; we deter-</p>
<p>mined to remain several months in this wonderful</p>
<p>and celebrated city. Clerval desired the intercourse</p>
<p>of the men of genius and talent who ﬂourished at</p>
<p>this time; but this was with me a secondary ob-</p>
<p>ject; I was principally occupied with the means of</p>
<p>obtaining the information necessary for the comple-</p>
<p>tion of my promise, and quickly availed myself of</p>
<p>the letters of introduction that I had brought with</p>
<p>me, addressed to the most distinguished natural</p>
<p>philosophers.</p>
<p>283</p>
<p>If this journey had taken place during my days</p>
<p>of study and happiness, it would have afforded me</p>
<p>inexpressible pleasure. But a blight had come over</p>
<p>my existence, and I only visited these people for</p>
<p>the sake of the information they might give me on</p>
<p>the subject in which my interest was so terribly pro-</p>
<p>found. Company was irksome to me; when alone,</p>
<p>I could ﬁll my mind with the sights of heaven and</p>
<p>earth; the voice of Henry soothed me, and I could</p>
<p>thus cheat myself into a transitory peace. But busy</p>
<p>uninteresting joyous faces brought back despair to</p>
<p>my heart. I saw an insurmountable barrier placed</p>
<p>between me and my fellow-men; this barrier was</p>
<p>sealed with the blood of William and Justine; and to</p>
<p>reﬂect on the events connected with those names</p>
<p>ﬁlled my soul with anguish.</p>
<p>But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self;</p>
<p>he was inquisitive, and anxious to gain experience</p>
<p>and instruction. The difference of manners which</p>
<p>he observed was to him an inexhaustible source</p>
<p>of instruction and amusement. He was for ever</p>
<p>busy; and the only check to his enjoyments was</p>
<p>my sorrowful and dejected mien. I tried to conceal</p>
<p>this as much as possible, that I might not debar</p>
<p>him from the pleasures natural to one who was</p>
<p>entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by</p>
<p>any care or bitter recollection. I often refused to</p>
<p>accompany him, alleging another engagement, that</p>
<p>I might remain alone. I now also began to collect</p>
<p>the materials necessary for my new creation, and</p>
<p>this was to me like the torture of single drops of</p>
<p>water continually falling on the head. Every thought</p>
<p>that was devoted to it was an extreme anguish, and</p>
<p>every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my</p>
<p>lips to quiver, and my heart to palpitate.</p>
<p>After passing some months in London, we re-</p>
<p>ceived a letter from a person in Scotland, who had</p>
<p>formerly been our visitor at Geneva. He mentioned</p>
<p>the beauties of his native country, and asked us if</p>
<p>those were not sufﬁcient allurements to induce us to</p>
<p>prolong our journey as far north as Perth, where he</p>
<p>resided. Clerval eagerly desired to accept this invi-</p>
<p>tation; and I, although I abhorred society, wished to</p>
<p>view again mountains and streams, and all the won-</p>
<p>drous works with which Nature adorns her chosen</p>
<p>dwelling-places.</p>
<p>We had arrived in England at the beginning of</p>
<p>October, and it was now February. We accordingly</p>
<p>determined to commence our journey towards the</p>
<p>north at the expiration of another month. In this</p>
<p>expedition we did not intend to follow the great road</p>
<p>to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford, Matlock,</p>
<p>and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at</p>
<p>the completion of this tour about the end of July. I</p>
<p>packed my chemical instruments, and the materials</p>
<p>I had collected, resolving to ﬁnish my labours in</p>
<p>some obscure nook in the northern highlands of</p>
<p>Scotland.</p>
<p>We quitted London on the 27th of March, and</p>
<p>remained a few days at Windsor, rambling in its</p>
<p>beautiful forest. This was a new scene to us moun-</p>
<p>taineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game,</p>
<p>and the herds of stately deer, were all novelties to</p>
<p>us.</p>
<p>From thence we proceeded to Oxford. As we</p>
<p>entered this city, our minds were ﬁlled with the re-</p>
<p>membrance of the events that had been transacted</p>
<p>there more than a century and a half before. It was</p>
<p>here that Charles I. had collected his forces. This</p>
<p>city had remained faithful to him, after the whole</p>
<p>nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard</p>
<p>of parliament and liberty. The memory of that un-</p>
<p>fortunate king, and his companions, the amiable</p>
<p>Falkland, the insolent Gower, his queen, and son,</p>
<p>gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city,</p>
<p>which they might be supposed to have inhabited.</p>
<p>The spirit of elder days found a dwelling here, and</p>
<p>we delighted to trace its footsteps. If these feel-</p>
<p>ings had not found an imaginary gratiﬁcation, the</p>
<p>appearance of the city had yet in itself sufﬁcient</p>
<p>beauty to obtain our admiration. The colleges are</p>
<p>ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost</p>
<p>magniﬁcent; and the lovely Isis, which ﬂows beside</p>
<p>it through meadows of exquisite verdure, is spread</p>
<p>forth into a placid expanse of waters, which reﬂects</p>
<p>its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and</p>
<p>domes, embosomed among aged trees.</p>
<p>I enjoyed this scene; and yet my enjoyment was</p>
<p>embittered both by the memory of the past, and the</p>
<p>anticipation of the future. I was formed for peaceful</p>
<p>happiness. During my youthful days discontent</p>
<p>never visited my mind; and if I was ever overcome</p>
<p>by ennui, the sight of what is beautiful in nature, or</p>
<p>the study of what is excellent and sublime in the</p>
<p>productions of man, could always interest my heart,</p>
<p>and communicate elasticity to my spirits. But I am</p>
<p>a blasted tree; the bolt has entered my soul; and</p>
<p>I felt then that I should survive to exhibit, what I</p>
<p>shall soon cease to be — a miserable spectacle of</p>
<p>wrecked humanity, pitiable to others, and abhorrent</p>
<p>to myself.</p>
<p>We passed a considerable period at Oxford,</p>
<p>rambling among its environs, and endeavouring to</p>
<p>identify every spot which might relate to the most</p>
<p>animating epoch of English history. Our little voy-</p>
<p>ages of discovery were often prolonged by the suc-</p>
<p>cessive objects that presented themselves. We</p>
<p>visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden, and the</p>
<p>ﬁeld on which that patriot fell. For a moment my</p>
<p>soul was elevated from its debasing and miserable</p>
<p>fears to contemplate the divine ideas of liberty and</p>
<p>self-sacriﬁce, of which these sights were the mon-</p>
<p>uments and the remembrancers. For an instant I</p>
<p>dared to shake off my chains, and look around me</p>
<p>with a free and lofty spirit; but the iron had eaten into</p>
<p>my ﬂesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless,</p>
<p>into my miserable self.</p>
<p>We left Oxford with regret, and proceeded to</p>
<p>Matlock, which was our next place of rest. The</p>
<p>country in the neighbourhood of this village resem-</p>
<p>bled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzer-</p>
<p>land; but every thing is on a lower scale, and the</p>
<p>green hills want the crown of distant white Alps,</p>
<p>which always attend on the piny mountains of my</p>
<p>native country. We visited the wondrous cave, and</p>
<p>the little cabinets of natural history, where the cu-</p>
<p>riosities are disposed in the same manner as in</p>
<p>the collections at Servox and Chamounix. The lat-</p>
<p>ter name made me tremble, when pronounced by</p>
<p>Henry; and I hastened to quit Matlock, with which</p>
<p>that terrible scene was thus associated.</p>
<p>From Derby still journeying northward, we</p>
<p>passed two months in Cumberland and Westmore-</p>
<p>land. I could now almost fancy myself among the</p>
<p>Swiss mountains. The little patches of snow which</p>
<p>yet lingered on the northern sides of the mountains,</p>
<p>the lakes, and the dashing of the rocky streams,</p>
<p>were all familiar and dear sights to me. Here also</p>
<p>we made some acquaintances, who almost con-</p>
<p>trived to cheat me into happiness. The delight of</p>
<p>Clerval was proportionably greater than mine; his</p>
<p>mind expanded in the company of men of talent,</p>
<p>and he found in his own nature greater capacities</p>
<p>and resources than he could have imagined himself</p>
<p>to have possessed while he associated with his</p>
<p>inferiors. “I could pass my life here,” said he to</p>
<p>me; “and among these mountains I should scarcely</p>
<p>regret Switzerland and the Rhine.”</p>
<p>But he found that a traveller’s life is one that</p>
<p>includes much pain amidst its enjoyments. His feel-</p>
<p>ings are for ever on the stretch; and when he begins</p>
<p>to sink into repose, he ﬁnds himself obliged to quit</p>
<p>that on which he rests in pleasure for something</p>
<p>new, which again engages his attention, and which</p>
<p>also he forsakes for other novelties.</p>
<p>We had scarcely visited the various lakes of</p>
<p>Cumberland and Westmoreland, and conceived</p>
<p>an affection for some of the inhabitants, when the</p>
<p>period of our appointment with our Scotch friend</p>
<p>approached, and we left them to travel on. For my</p>
<p>own part I was not sorry. I had now neglected my</p>
<p>promise for some time, and I feared the effects of</p>
<p>the dæmon’s disappointment. He might remain in</p>
<p>Switzerland, and wreak his vengeance on my rela-</p>
<p>tives. This idea pursued me, and tormented me at</p>
<p>every moment from which I might otherwise have</p>
<p>snatched repose and peace. I waited for my letters</p>
<p>with feverish impatience: if they were delayed, I was</p>
<p>miserable, and overcome by a thousand fears; and</p>
<p>when they arrived, and I saw the superscription of</p>
<p>Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to read and</p>
<p>ascertain my fate. Sometimes I thought that the</p>
<p>ﬁend followed me, and might expedite my remiss-</p>
<p>ness by murdering my companion. When these</p>
<p>thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for</p>
<p>a moment, but followed him as his shadow, to pro-</p>
<p>tect him from the fancied rage of his destroyer. I felt</p>
<p>as if I had committed some great crime, the con-</p>
<p>sciousness of which haunted me. I was guiltless,</p>
<p>but I had indeed drawn down a horrible curse upon</p>
<p>my head, as mortal as that of crime.</p>
<p>I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind;</p>
<p>and yet that city might have interested the most</p>
<p>unfortunate being. Clerval did not like it so well</p>
<p>as Oxford; for the antiquity of the latter city was</p>
<p>more pleasing to him. But the beauty and regularity</p>
<p>of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic castle,</p>
<p>and its environs, the most delightful in the world,</p>
<p>Arthur’s Seat, St. Bernard’s Well, and the Pentland</p>
<p>Hills, compensated him for the change, and ﬁlled</p>
<p>him with cheerfulness and admiration. But I was</p>
<p>impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.</p>
<p>We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through</p>
<p>Coupar, St. Andrews, and along the banks of the</p>
<p>Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us. But I</p>
<p>was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers, or</p>
<p>enter into their feelings or plans with the good hu-</p>
<p>mour expected from a guest; and accordingly I told</p>
<p>Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland</p>
<p>alone. “Do you,” said I, “enjoy yourself, and let this</p>
<p>be our rendezvous. I may be absent a month or two;</p>
<p>but do not interfere with my motions, I entreat you:</p>
<p>leave me to peace and solitude for a short time;</p>
<p>and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter</p>
<p>heart, more congenial to your own temper.”</p>
<p>Henry wished to dissuade me; but, seeing me</p>
<p>bent on this plan, ceased to remonstrate. He en-</p>
<p>treated me to write often. “I had rather be with you,”</p>
<p>he said, “in your solitary rambles, than with these</p>
<p>Scotch people, whom I do not know: hasten then,</p>
<p>my dear friend, to return, that I may again feel my-</p>
<p>self somewhat at home, which I cannot do in your</p>
<p>absence.”</p>
<p>Having parted from my friend, I determined to</p>
<p>visit some remote spot of Scotland, and ﬁnish my</p>
<p>work in solitude. I did not doubt but that the mon-</p>
<p>ster followed me, and would discover himself to me</p>
<p>when I should have ﬁnished, that he might receive</p>
<p>his companion.</p>
<p>With this resolution I traversed the northern</p>
<p>highlands, and ﬁxed on one of the remotest of the</p>
<p>Orkneys as the scene labours. It was a place ﬁtted</p>
<p>for such a work, being hardly more than a rock,</p>
<p>whose high sides were continually beaten upon by</p>
<p>the waves. The soil was barren, scarcely afford-</p>
<p>ing pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal</p>
<p>for its inhabitants, which consisted of ﬁve persons,</p>
<p>whose gaunt and scraggy limbs gave tokens of their</p>
<p>miserable fare. Vegetables and bread, when they</p>
<p>indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water,</p>
<p>was to be procured from the main land, which was</p>
<p>about ﬁve miles distant.</p>
<p>On the whole island there were but three mis-</p>
<p>erable huts, and one of these was vacant when I</p>
<p>arrived. This I hired. It contained but two rooms,</p>
<p>and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most</p>
<p>miserable penury. The thatch had fallen in, the</p>
<p>walls were unplastered, and the door was off its</p>
<p>hinges. I ordered it to be repaired, bought some</p>
<p>furniture, and took possession; an incident which</p>
<p>would, doubtless, have occasioned some surprise,</p>
<p>had not all the senses of the cottagers been be-</p>
<p>numbed by want and squalid poverty. As it was, I</p>
<p>lived ungazed at and unmolested, hardly thanked</p>
<p>for the pittance of food and clothes which I gave;</p>
<p>so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest</p>
<p>sensations of men.</p>
<p>In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour;</p>
<p>but in the evening, when the weather permitted, I</p>
<p>walked on the stony beach of the sea, to listen to the</p>
<p>waves as they roared, and dashed at my feet. It was</p>
<p>a monotonous, yet ever-changing scene. I thought</p>
<p>of Switzerland; it was far different from this desolate</p>
<p>and appalling landscape. Its hills are covered with</p>
<p>vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the</p>
<p>plains. Its fair lakes reﬂect a blue and gentle sky;</p>
<p>and, when troubled by the winds, their tumult is but</p>
<p>as the play of a lively infant, when compared to the</p>
<p>roarings of the giant ocean.</p>
<p>In this manner I distributed my occupations</p>
<p>when I ﬁrst arrived; but, as I proceeded in my labour,</p>
<p>it became every day more horrible and irksome to</p>
<p>me. Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to</p>
<p>enter my laboratory for several days; and at other</p>
<p>times I toiled day and night in order to complete</p>
<p>my work. It was indeed a ﬁlthy process in which I</p>
<p>was engaged. During my ﬁrst experiment, a kind</p>
<p>of enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror</p>
<p>of my employment; my mind was intently ﬁxed on</p>
<p>the sequel of my labour, and my eyes were shut to</p>
<p>the horror of my proceedings. But now I went to it</p>
<p>in cold blood, and my heart often sickened at the</p>
<p>work of my hands.</p>
<p>Thus situated, employed in the most detestable</p>
<p>occupation, immersed in a solitude where nothing</p>
<p>could for an instant call my attention from the actual</p>
<p>scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became</p>
<p>unequal; I grew restless and nervous. Every mo-</p>
<p>ment I feared to meet my persecutor. Sometimes</p>
<p>I sat with my eyes ﬁxed on the ground, fearing to</p>
<p>raise them lest they should encounter the object</p>
<p>which I so much dreaded to behold. I feared to wan-</p>
<p>der from the sight of my fellow-creatures, lest when</p>
<p>alone he should come to claim his companion.</p>
<p>In the mean time I worked on, and my labour</p>
<p>was already considerably advanced. I looked to-</p>
<p>wards its completion with a tremulous and eager</p>
<p>hope, which I dared not trust myself to question,</p>
<p>but which was intermixed with obscure forebodings</p>
<p>of evil, that made my heart sicken in my bosom.</p>
<p>Chapter III</p>
<p>I SAT one evening in my laboratory; the sun had</p>
<p>set, and the moon was just rising from the sea; I</p>
<p>had not sufﬁcient light for my employment, and I re-</p>
<p>mained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether</p>
<p>I should leave my labour for the night, or hasten its</p>
<p>conclusion by an unremitting attention to it. As I sat,</p>
<p>a train of reﬂection occurred to me, which led me to</p>
<p>consider the effects of what I was now doing. Three</p>
<p>years before I was engaged in the same manner,</p>
<p>and had created a ﬁend whose unparalleled bar-</p>
<p>barity had desolated my heart, and ﬁlled it for ever</p>
<p>with the bitterest remorse. I was now about to form</p>
<p>298</p>
<p>another being, of whose dispositions I was alike</p>
<p>ignorant; she might become ten thousand times</p>
<p>more malignant than her mate, and delight, for its</p>
<p>own sake, in murder and wretchedness. He had</p>
<p>sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man, and hide</p>
<p>himself in deserts; but she had not; and she, who in</p>
<p>all probability was to become a thinking and reason-</p>
<p>ing animal, might refuse to comply with a compact</p>
<p>made before her creation. They might even hate</p>
<p>each other; the creature who already lived loathed</p>
<p>his own deformity, and might he not conceive a</p>
<p>greater abhorence for it when it came before his</p>
<p>eyes in the female form? She also might turn with</p>
<p>disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she</p>
<p>might quit him, and he be again alone, exasperated</p>
<p>by the fresh provocation of being deserted by one</p>
<p>of his own species.</p>
<p>Even if they were to leave Europe, and inhabit</p>
<p>the deserts of the new world, yet one of the ﬁrst</p>
<p>results of those sympathies for which the dæmon</p>
<p>thirsted would be children, and a race of devils</p>
<p>would be propagated upon the earth, who might</p>
<p>make the very existence of the species of man</p>
<p>a condition precarious and full of terror. Had I a</p>
<p>right, for my own beneﬁt, to inﬂict this curse upon</p>
<p>everlasting generations? I had before been moved</p>
<p>by the sophisms of the being I had created; I had</p>
<p>been struck senseless by his ﬁendish threats: but</p>
<p>now, for the ﬁrst time, the wickedness of my promise</p>
<p>burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages</p>
<p>might curse me as their pest, whose selﬁshness</p>
<p>had not hesitated to buy its own peace at the price</p>
<p>perhaps of the existence of the whole human race.</p>
<p>I trembled, and my heart failed within me; when,</p>
<p>on looking up, I saw, by the light of the moon, the</p>
<p>dæmon at the casement. A ghastly grin wrinkled his</p>
<p>lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulﬁlling the task</p>
<p>which he had allotted to me. Yes, he had followed</p>
<p>me in my travels; he had loitered in forests, hid</p>
<p>himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide and desert</p>
<p>heaths; and he now came to mark my progress,</p>
<p>and claim the fulﬁlment of my promise.</p>
<p>As I looked on him, his countenance expressed</p>
<p>the utmost extent of malice and treachery. I thought</p>
<p>with a sensation of madness on my promise of</p>
<p>creating another like to him, and, trembling with</p>
<p>passion, tore to pieces the thing on which I was en-</p>
<p>gaged. The wretch saw me destroy the creature on</p>
<p>whose future existence he depended for happiness,</p>
<p>and, with a howl of devilish despair and revenge,</p>
<p>withdrew.</p>
<p>I left the room, and, locking the door, made a</p>
<p>solemn vow in my own heart never to resume my</p>
<p>labours; and then, with trembling steps, I sought</p>
<p>my own apartment. I was alone; none were near</p>
<p>me to dissipate the gloom, and relieve me from the</p>
<p>sickening oppression of the most terrible reveries.</p>
<p>Several hours past, and I remained near my</p>
<p>window gazing on the sea; it was almost motion-</p>
<p>less, for the winds were hushed, and all nature</p>
<p>reposed under the eye of the quiet moon. A few</p>
<p>ﬁshing vessels alone specked the water, and now</p>
<p>and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound of</p>
<p>voices, as the ﬁshermen called to one another. I</p>
<p>felt the silence, although I was hardly conscious of</p>
<p>its extreme profundity until my ear was suddenly</p>
<p>arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore,</p>
<p>and a person landed close to my house.</p>
<p>In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my</p>
<p>door, as if some one endeavoured to open it softly.</p>
<p>I trembled from head to foot; I felt a presentiment of</p>
<p>who it was, and wished to rouse one of the peasants</p>
<p>who dwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I</p>
<p>was overcome by the sensation of helplessness,</p>
<p>so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain</p>
<p>endeavour to ﬂy from an impending danger, and</p>
<p>was rooted to the spot.</p>
<p>Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along</p>
<p>the passage; the door opened, and the wretch</p>
<p>whom I dreaded appeared. Shutting the door, he</p>
<p>approached me, and said, in a smothered voice —</p>
<p>“You have destroyed the work which you began;</p>
<p>what is it that you intend? Do you dare to break</p>
<p>your promise? I have endured toil and misery: I left</p>
<p>Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of</p>
<p>the Rhine, among its willow islands, and over the</p>
<p>summits of its hills. I have dwelt many months in</p>
<p>the heaths of England, and among the deserts of</p>
<p>Scotland. I have endured incalculable fatigue, and</p>
<p>cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy my hopes?”</p>
<p>“Begone! I do break my promise; never will I</p>
<p>create another like yourself, equal in deformity and</p>
<p>wickedness.”</p>
<p>“Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have</p>
<p>proved yourself unworthy of my condescension. Re-</p>
<p>member that I have power; you believe yourself</p>
<p>miserable, but I can make you so wretched that</p>
<p>the light of day will be hateful to you. You are my</p>
<p>creator, but I am your master; — obey!”</p>
<p>“The hour of my weakness is past, and the pe-</p>
<p>riod of your power is arrived. Your threats cannot</p>
<p>move me to do an act of wickedness; but they con-</p>
<p>ﬁrm me in a resolution of not creating you a com-</p>
<p>panion in vice. Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon</p>
<p>the earth a dæmon, whose delight is in death and</p>
<p>wretchedness. Begone! I am ﬁrm, and your words</p>
<p>will only exasperate my rage.”</p>
<p>The monster saw my determination in my face,</p>
<p>and gnashed his teeth in the impotence of anger.</p>
<p>“Shall each man,” cried he, “ﬁnd a wife for his bos-</p>
<p>om, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone?</p>
<p>I had feelings of affection, and they were requited</p>
<p>by detestation and scorn. Man, you may hate; but</p>
<p>beware! Your hours will pass in dread and misery,</p>
<p>and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you</p>
<p>your happiness for ever. Are you to be happy, while</p>
<p>I grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness? You</p>
<p>can blast my other passions; but revenge remains</p>
<p>— revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food! I</p>
<p>may die; but ﬁrst you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall</p>
<p>curse the sun that gazes on your misery. Beware;</p>
<p>for I am fearless, and therefore powerful. I will watch</p>
<p>with the wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with</p>
<p>its venom. Man, you shall repent of the injuries you</p>
<p>inﬂict.”</p>
<p>“Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with</p>
<p>these sounds of malice. I have declared my reso-</p>
<p>lution to you, and I am no coward to bend beneath</p>
<p>words. Leave me; I am inexorable.”</p>
<p>“It is well. I go; but remember, I shall be with</p>
<p>you on your wedding-night.”</p>
<p>I started forward, and exclaimed, “Villain! before</p>
<p>you sign my death-warrant, be sure that you are</p>
<p>yourself safe.”</p>
<p>I would have seized him; but he eluded me,</p>
<p>and quitted the house with precipitation: in a few</p>
<p>moments I saw him in his boat, which shot across</p>
<p>the waters with an arrowy swiftness, and was soon</p>
<p>lost amidst the waves.</p>
<p>All was again silent; but his words rung in my</p>
<p>ears. I burned with rage to pursue the murderer</p>
<p>of my peace, and precipitate him into the ocean. I</p>
<p>walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed,</p>
<p>while my imagination conjured up a thousand im-</p>
<p>ages to torment and sting me. Why had I not fol-</p>
<p>lowed him, and closed with him in mortal strife? But</p>
<p>I had suffered him to depart, and he had directed</p>
<p>his course towards the main land. I shuddered to</p>
<p>think who might be the next victim sacriﬁced to his</p>
<p>insatiate revenge. And then I thought again of his</p>
<p>words — “I will be with you on your wedding-night.”</p>
<p>That then was the period ﬁxed for the fulﬁlment of</p>
<p>my destiny. In that hour I should die, and at once</p>
<p>satisfy and extinguish his malice. The prospect</p>
<p>did not move me to fear; yet when I thought of my</p>
<p>beloved Elizabeth, — of her tears and endless sor-</p>
<p>row, when she should ﬁnd her lover so barbarously</p>
<p>snatched from her, — tears, the ﬁrst I had shed</p>
<p>for many months, streamed from my eyes, and I</p>
<p>resolved not to fall before my enemy without a bitter</p>
<p>struggle.</p>
<p>The night passed away, and the sun rose from</p>
<p>the ocean; my feelings became calmer, if it may be</p>
<p>called calmness, when the violence of rage sinks</p>
<p>into the depths of despair. I left the house, the horrid</p>
<p>scene of the last night’s contention, and walked on</p>
<p>the beach of the sea, which I almost regarded as</p>
<p>an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow-</p>
<p>creatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the</p>
<p>fact stole across me. I desired that I might pass</p>
<p>my life on that barren rock, wearily it is true, but</p>
<p>uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery. If I</p>
<p>returned, it was to be sacriﬁced, or to see those</p>
<p>whom I most loved die under the grasp of a dæmon</p>
<p>whom I had myself created.</p>
<p>I walked about the isle like a restless spectre,</p>
<p>separated from all it loved, and miserable in the sep-</p>
<p>aration. When it became noon, and the sun rose</p>
<p>higher, I lay down on the grass, and was overpow-</p>
<p>ered by a deep sleep. I had been awake the whole</p>
<p>of the preceding night, my nerves were agitated,</p>
<p>and my eyes inﬂamed by watching and misery. The</p>
<p>sleep into which I now sunk refreshed me; and</p>
<p>when I awoke, I again felt as if I belonged to a race</p>
<p>of human beings like myself, and I began to reﬂect</p>
<p>upon what had passed with greater composure; yet</p>
<p>still the words of the ﬁend rung in my ears like a</p>
<p>death-knell, they appeared like a dream, yet distinct</p>
<p>and oppressive as a reality.</p>
<p>The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the</p>
<p>shore, satisfying my appetite, which had become</p>
<p>ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a ﬁshing-</p>
<p>boat land close to me, and one of the men brought</p>
<p>me a packet; it contained letters from Geneva, and</p>
<p>one from Clerval, entreating me to join him. He</p>
<p>said that nearly a year had elapsed since we had</p>
<p>quitted Switzerland, and France was yet unvisited.</p>
<p>He entreated me, therefore, to leave my solitary</p>
<p>isle, and meet him at Perth, in a week from that</p>
<p>time, when we might arrange the plan of our future</p>
<p>proceedings. This letter in a degree recalled me</p>
<p>to life, and I determined to quit my island at the</p>
<p>expiration of two days.</p>
<p>Yet, before I departed, there was a task to per-</p>
<p>form, on which I shuddered to reﬂect: I must pack</p>
<p>my chemical instruments; and for that purpose I</p>
<p>must enter the room which had been the scene</p>
<p>of my odious work, and I must handle those uten-</p>
<p>sils, the sight of which was sickening to me. The</p>
<p>next morning, at day-break, I summoned sufﬁcient</p>
<p>courage, and unlocked the door of my laboratory.</p>
<p>The remains of the half-ﬁnished creature, whom</p>
<p>I had destroyed, lay scattered on the ﬂoor, and I</p>
<p>almost felt as if I had mangled the living ﬂesh of</p>
<p>a human being. I paused to collect myself, and</p>
<p>then entered the chamber. With trembling hand</p>
<p>I conveyed the instruments out of the room; but</p>
<p>I reﬂected that I ought not to leave the relics of</p>
<p>my work to excite the horror and suspicion of the</p>
<p>peasants, and I accordingly put them into a basket,</p>
<p>with a great quantity of stones, and laying them up,</p>
<p>determined to throw them into the sea that very</p>
<p>night; and in the mean time I sat upon the beach,</p>
<p>employed in cleaning and arranging my chemical</p>
<p>apparatus.</p>
<p>Nothing could be more complete than the al-</p>
<p>teration that had taken place in my feelings since</p>
<p>the night of the appearance of the dæmon. I had</p>
<p>before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair,</p>
<p>as a thing that, with whatever consequences, must</p>
<p>be fulﬁlled; but I now felt as if a ﬁlm had been taken</p>
<p>from before my eyes, and that I, for the ﬁrst time,</p>
<p>saw clearly. The idea of renewing my labours did</p>
<p>not for one instant occur to me; the threat I had</p>
<p>heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not reﬂect</p>
<p>that a voluntary act of mine could avert it. I had</p>
<p>resolved in my own mind, that to create another</p>
<p>like the ﬁend I had ﬁrst made would be an act of</p>
<p>the basest and most atrocious selﬁshness; and I</p>
<p>banished from my mind every thought that could</p>
<p>lead to a different conclusion.</p>
<p>Between two and three in the morning the moon</p>
<p>rose; and I then, putting my basket aboard a little</p>
<p>skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore.</p>
<p>The scene was perfectly solitary: a few boats were</p>
<p>returning towards land, but I sailed away from them.</p>
<p>I felt as if I was about the commission of a dreadful</p>
<p>crime, and avoided with shuddering anxiety any en-</p>
<p>counter with my fellow-creatures. At one time the</p>
<p>moon, which had before been clear, was suddenly</p>
<p>overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage</p>
<p>of the moment of darkness, and cast my basket</p>
<p>into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound as it</p>
<p>sunk, and then sailed away from the spot. The sky</p>
<p>became clouded; but the air was pure, although</p>
<p>chilled by the north-east breeze that was then ris-</p>
<p>ing. But it refreshed me, and ﬁlled me with such</p>
<p>agreeable sensations, that I resolved to prolong my</p>
<p>stay on the water, and ﬁxing the rudder in a direct</p>
<p>position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat.</p>
<p>Clouds hid the moon, every thing was obscure, and</p>
<p>I heard only the sound of the boat, as its keel cut</p>
<p>through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a</p>
<p>short time I slept soundly.</p>
<p>I do not know how long I remained in this situ-</p>
<p>ation, but when I awoke I found that the sun had</p>
<p>already mounted considerably. The wind was high,</p>
<p>and the waves continually threatened the safety of</p>
<p>my little skiff. I found that the wind was north-east,</p>
<p>and must have driven me far from the coast from</p>
<p>which I had embarked. I endeavoured to change</p>
<p>my course, but quickly found that if I again made</p>
<p>the attempt the boat would be instantly ﬁlled with</p>
<p>water. Thus situated, my only resource was to drive</p>
<p>before the wind. I confess that I felt a few sensa-</p>
<p>tions of terror. I had no compass with me, and was</p>
<p>so little acquainted with the geography of this part</p>
<p>of the world that the sun was of little beneﬁt to me.</p>
<p>I might be driven into the wide Atlantic, and feel</p>
<p>all the tortures of starvation, or be swallowed up in</p>
<p>the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted</p>
<p>around me. I had already been out many hours,</p>
<p>and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to</p>
<p>my other sufferings. I looked on the heavens, which</p>
<p>were covered by clouds that ﬂew before the wind</p>
<p>only to be replaced by others: I looked upon the</p>
<p>sea, it was to be my grave. “Fiend,” I exclaimed,</p>
<p>“your task is already fulﬁlled!” I thought of Elizabeth,</p>
<p>of my father, and of Clerval; and sunk into a reverie,</p>
<p>so despairing and frightful, that even now, when the</p>
<p>scene is on the point of closing before me for ever,</p>
<p>I shudder to reﬂect on it.</p>
<p>Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as</p>
<p>the sun declined towards the horizon, the wind died</p>
<p>away into a gentle breeze, and the sea became free</p>
<p>from breakers. But these gave place to a heavy</p>
<p>swell; I felt sick, and hardly able to hold the rudder,</p>
<p>when suddenly I saw a line of high land towards the</p>
<p>south.</p>
<p>Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue, and the</p>
<p>dreadful suspense I endured for several hours, this</p>
<p>sudden certainty of life rushed like a ﬂood of warm</p>
<p>joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.</p>
<p>How mutable are our feelings, and how strange</p>
<p>is that clinging love we have of life even in the ex-</p>
<p>cess of misery! I constructed another sail with a</p>
<p>part of my dress, and eagerly steered my course to-</p>
<p>wards the land. It had a wild and rocky appearance;</p>
<p>but as I approached nearer, I easily perceived the</p>
<p>traces of cultivation. I saw vessels near the shore,</p>
<p>and found myself suddenly transported back to the</p>
<p>neighbourhood of civilized man. I eagerly traced the</p>
<p>windings of the land, and hailed a steeple which I at</p>
<p>length saw issuing from behind a small promontory.</p>
<p>As I was in a state of extreme debility, I resolved</p>
<p>to sail directly towards the town as a place where I</p>
<p>could most easily procure nourishment. Fortunately</p>
<p>I had money with me. As I turned the promontory,</p>
<p>I perceived a small neat town and a good harbour,</p>
<p>which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my</p>
<p>unexpected escape.</p>
<p>As I was occupied in ﬁxing the boat and arrang-</p>
<p>ing the sails, several people crowded towards the</p>
<p>spot. They seemed very much surprised at my</p>
<p>appearance; but, instead of offering me any assis-</p>
<p>tance, whispered together with gestures that at any</p>
<p>other time might have produced in me a slight sen-</p>
<p>sation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that</p>
<p>they spoke English; and I therefore addressed them</p>
<p>in that language: “My good friends,” said I, “will you</p>
<p>be so kind as to tell me the name of this town, and</p>
<p>inform me where I am?”</p>
<p>“You will know that soon enough,” replied a man</p>
<p>with a gruff voice. “May be you are come to a place</p>
<p>that will not prove much to your taste; but you will</p>
<p>not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you.”</p>
<p>I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so</p>
<p>rude an answer from a stranger; and I was also</p>
<p>disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and angry</p>
<p>countenances of his companions. “Why do you</p>
<p>answer me so roughly?” I replied: “surely it is not</p>
<p>the custom of Englishmen to receive strangers so</p>
<p>inhospitably.”</p>
<p>“I do not know,” said the man, “what the custom</p>
<p>of the English may be; but it is the custom of the</p>
<p>Irish to hate villains.”</p>
<p>While this strange dialogue continued, I per-</p>
<p>ceived the crowd rapidly increase. Their faces ex-</p>
<p>pressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which an-</p>
<p>noyed, and in some degree alarmed me. I inquired</p>
<p>the way to the inn; but no one replied. I then moved</p>
<p>forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the</p>
<p>crowd as they followed and surrounded me; when</p>
<p>an ill-looking man approaching, tapped me on the</p>
<p>shoulder, and said, “Come, Sir, you must follow me</p>
<p>to Mr. Kirwin’s, to give an account of yourself.”</p>
<p>“Who is Mr. Kirwin? Why am I to give an ac-</p>
<p>count of myself? Is not this a free country?”</p>
<p>“Aye, Sir, free enough for honest folks. Mr. Kir-</p>
<p>win is a magistrate; and you are to give an account</p>
<p>of the death of a gentleman who was found mur-</p>
<p>dered here last night.”</p>
<p>This answer startled me; but I presently recov-</p>
<p>ered myself. I was innocent; that could easily be</p>
<p>proved: accordingly I followed my conductor in si-</p>
<p>lence, and was led to one of the best houses in the</p>
<p>town. I was ready to sink from fatigue and hunger;</p>
<p>but, being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic</p>
<p>to rouse all my strength, that no physical debility</p>
<p>might be construed into apprehension or conscious</p>
<p>guilt. Little did I then expect the calamity that was</p>
<p>in a few moments to overwhelm me, and extinguish</p>
<p>in horror and despair all fear of ignominy or death.</p>
<p>I must pause here; for it requires all my forti-</p>
<p>tude to recall the memory of the frightful events</p>
<p>which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to my</p>
<p>recollection.</p>
<p>Chapter IV</p>
<p>I WAS soon introduced into the presence of the mag-</p>
<p>istrate, an old benevolent man, with calm and mild</p>
<p>manners. He looked upon me, however, with some</p>
<p>degree of severity; and then, turning towards my</p>
<p>conductors, he asked who appeared as witnesses</p>
<p>on this occasion.</p>
<p>About half a dozen men came forward; and one</p>
<p>being selected by the magistrate, he deposed, that</p>
<p>he had been out ﬁshing the night before with his</p>
<p>son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about</p>
<p>ten o’clock, they observed a strong northerly blast</p>
<p>rising, and they accordingly put in for port. It was a</p>
<p>317</p>
<p>very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they</p>
<p>did not land at the harbour, but, as they had been</p>
<p>accustomed, at a creek about two miles below. He</p>
<p>walked on ﬁrst, carrying a part of the ﬁshing tackle,</p>
<p>and his companions followed him at some distance.</p>
<p>As he was proceeding along the sands, he struck</p>
<p>his foot against something, and fell all his length on</p>
<p>the ground. His companions came up to assist him;</p>
<p>and, by the light of their lantern, they found that he</p>
<p>had fallen on the body of a man, who was to all</p>
<p>appearance dead. Their ﬁrst supposition was, that</p>
<p>it was the corpse of some person who had been</p>
<p>drowned, and was thrown on shore by the waves;</p>
<p>but, upon examination, they found that the clothes</p>
<p>were not wet, and even that the body was not then</p>
<p>cold. They instantly carried it to the cottage of an</p>
<p>old woman near the spot, and endeavoured, but</p>
<p>in vain, to restore it to life. He appeared to be a</p>
<p>handsome young man, about ﬁve and twenty years</p>
<p>of age. He had apparently been strangled; for there</p>
<p>was no sign of any violence, except the black mark</p>
<p>of ﬁngers on his neck.</p>
<p>The ﬁrst part of this deposition did not in the</p>
<p>least interest me; but when the mark of the ﬁn-</p>
<p>gers was mentioned, I remembered the murder of</p>
<p>my brother, and felt myself extremely agitated; my</p>
<p>limbs trembled, and a mist came over my eyes,</p>
<p>which obliged me to lean on a chair for support.</p>
<p>The magistrate observed me with a keen eye, and</p>
<p>of course drew an unfavourable augury from my</p>
<p>manner.</p>
<p>The son conﬁrmed his father’s account: but</p>
<p>when Daniel Nugent was called, he swore positively</p>
<p>that, just before the fall of his companion, he saw</p>
<p>a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance</p>
<p>from the shore; and, as far as he could judge by the</p>
<p>light of a few stars, it was the same boat in which I</p>
<p>had just landed.</p>
<p>A woman deposed, that she lived near the</p>
<p>beach, and was standing at the door of her cottage,</p>
<p>waiting for the return of the ﬁshermen, about an</p>
<p>hour before she heard of the discovery of the body,</p>
<p>when she saw a boat, with only one man in it, push</p>
<p>off from that part of the shore where the corpse</p>
<p>was afterwards found.</p>
<p>Another woman conﬁrmed the account of the</p>
<p>ﬁshermen having brought the body into her house;</p>
<p>it was not cold. They put it into a bed, and rubbed</p>
<p>it; and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary,</p>
<p>but life was quite gone.</p>
<p>Several other men were examined concerning</p>
<p>my landing; and they agreed, that, with the strong</p>
<p>north wind that had arisen during the night, it was</p>
<p>very probable that I had beaten about for many</p>
<p>hours, and had been obliged to return nearly to the</p>
<p>same spot from which I had departed. Besides,</p>
<p>they observed that it appeared that I had brought</p>
<p>the body from another place, and it was likely, that</p>
<p>as I did not appear to know the shore, I might have</p>
<p>put into the harbour ignorant of the distance of the</p>
<p>town of —— from the place where I had deposited</p>
<p>the corpse.</p>
<p>Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired</p>
<p>that I should be taken into the room where the body</p>
<p>lay for interment that it might be observed what ef-</p>
<p>fect the sight of it would produce upon me. This</p>
<p>idea was probably suggested by the extreme agita-</p>
<p>tion I had exhibited when the mode of the murder</p>
<p>had been described. I was accordingly conducted,</p>
<p>by the magistrate and several other persons, to the</p>
<p>inn. I could not help being struck by the strange</p>
<p>coincidences that had taken place during this event-</p>
<p>ful night; but, knowing that I had been conversing</p>
<p>with several persons in the island I had inhabited</p>
<p>about the time that the body had been found, I was</p>
<p>perfectly tranquil as to the consequences of the</p>
<p>affair.</p>
<p>I entered the room where the corpse lay, and</p>
<p>was led up to the cofﬁn. How can I describe my</p>
<p>sensations on beholding it? I feel yet parched with</p>
<p>horror, nor can I reﬂect on that terrible moment</p>
<p>without shuddering and agony, that faintly reminds</p>
<p>me of the anguish of the recognition. The trial, the</p>
<p>presence of the magistrate and witnesses, passed</p>
<p>like a dream from my memory, when I saw the</p>
<p>lifeless form of Henry Clerval stretched before me. I</p>
<p>gasped for breath; and, throwing myself on the body,</p>
<p>I exclaimed, “Have my murderous machinations</p>
<p>deprived you also, my dearest Henry, of life? Two</p>
<p>I have already destroyed; other victims await their</p>
<p>destiny: but you, Clerval, my friend, my benefactor”</p>
<p>——</p>
<p>The human frame could no longer support the</p>
<p>agonizing suffering that I endured, and I was carried</p>
<p>out of the room in strong convulsions.</p>
<p>A fever succeeded to this. I lay for two months</p>
<p>on the point of death: my ravings, as I afterwards</p>
<p>heard, were frightful; I called myself the murderer</p>
<p>of William, of Justine, and of Clerval. Sometimes</p>
<p>I entreated my attendants to assist me in the de-</p>
<p>struction of the ﬁend by whom I was tormented;</p>
<p>and, at others, I felt the ﬁngers of the monster al-</p>
<p>ready grasping my neck, and screamed aloud with</p>
<p>agony and terror. Fortunately, as I spoke my native</p>
<p>language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but my</p>
<p>gestures and bitter cries were sufﬁcient to affright</p>
<p>the other witnesses.</p>
<p>Why did I not die? More miserable than man</p>
<p>ever was before, why did I not sink into forgetfulness</p>
<p>and rest? Death snatches away many blooming</p>
<p>children, the only hopes of their doating parents:</p>
<p>how many brides and youthful lovers have been</p>
<p>one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the</p>
<p>next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb!</p>
<p>Of what materials was I made, that I could thus</p>
<p>resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of the</p>
<p>wheel, continually renewed the torture.</p>
<p>But I was doomed to live; and, in two months,</p>
<p>found myself as awaking from a dream, in a prison,</p>
<p>stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by gaol-</p>
<p>ers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus</p>
<p>of a dungeon. It was morning, I remember, when</p>
<p>I thus awoke to understanding: I had forgotten the</p>
<p>particulars of what had happened, and only felt as if</p>
<p>some great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed</p>
<p>me; but when I looked around, and saw the barred</p>
<p>windows, and the squalidness of the room in which</p>
<p>I was, all ﬂashed across my memory, and I groaned</p>
<p>bitterly.</p>
<p>This sound disturbed an old woman who was</p>
<p>sleeping in a chair beside me. She was a hired</p>
<p>nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her coun-</p>
<p>tenance expressed all those bad qualities which</p>
<p>often characterize that class. The lines of her face</p>
<p>were hard and rude, like that of persons accus-</p>
<p>tomed to see without sympathizing in sights of mis-</p>
<p>ery. Her tone expressed her entire indifference; she</p>
<p>addressed me in English, and the voice struck me</p>
<p>as one that I had heard during my sufferings:</p>
<p>“Are you better now, Sir?” said she.</p>
<p>I replied in the same language, with a feeble</p>
<p>voice, “I believe I am; but if it be all true, if indeed I</p>
<p>did not dream, I am sorry that I am still alive to feel</p>
<p>this misery and horror.”</p>
<p>“For that matter,” replied the old woman, “if you</p>
<p>mean about the gentleman you murdered, I believe</p>
<p>that it were better for you if you were dead, for I</p>
<p>fancy it will go hard with you; but you will be hung</p>
<p>when the next sessions come on. However, that’s</p>
<p>none of my business, I am sent to nurse you, and</p>
<p>get you well; I do my duty with a safe conscience, it</p>
<p>were well if every body did the same.”</p>
<p>I turned with loathing from the woman who</p>
<p>could utter so unfeeling a speech to a person just</p>
<p>saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt languid,</p>
<p>and unable to reﬂect on all that had passed. The</p>
<p>whole series of my life appeared to me as a dream;</p>
<p>I sometimes doubted if indeed it were all true, for it</p>
<p>never presented itself to my mind with the force of</p>
<p>reality.</p>
<p>As the images that ﬂoated before me became</p>
<p>more distinct, I grew feverish; a darkness pressed</p>
<p>around me; no one was near me who soothed me</p>
<p>with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand sup-</p>
<p>ported me. The physician came and prescribed</p>
<p>medicines, and the old woman prepared them for</p>
<p>me; but utter carelessness was visible in the ﬁrst,</p>
<p>and the expression of brutality was strongly marked</p>
<p>in the visage of the second. Who could be inter-</p>
<p>ested in the fate of a murderer, but the hangman</p>
<p>who would gain his fee?</p>
<p>These were my ﬁrst reﬂections; but I soon</p>
<p>learned that Mr. Kirwin had shewn me extreme</p>
<p>kindness. He had caused the best room in the</p>
<p>prison to be prepared for me (wretched indeed was</p>
<p>the best); and it was he who had provided a physi-</p>
<p>cian and a nurse. It is true, he seldom came to see</p>
<p>me; for, although he ardently desired to relieve the</p>
<p>sufferings of every human creature, he did not wish</p>
<p>to be present at the agonies and miserable ravings</p>
<p>of a murderer. He came, therefore, sometimes to</p>
<p>see that I was not neglected; but his visits were</p>
<p>short, and at long intervals.</p>
<p>One day, when I was gradually recovering, I</p>
<p>was seated in a chair, my eyes half open, and my</p>
<p>cheeks livid like those in death, I was overcome by</p>
<p>gloom and misery, and often reﬂected I had better</p>
<p>seek death than remain miserably pent up only to</p>
<p>be let loose in a world replete with wretchedness. At</p>
<p>one time I considered whether I should not declare</p>
<p>myself guilty, and suffer the penalty of the law, less</p>
<p>innocent than poor Justine had been. Such were</p>
<p>my thoughts, when the door of my apartment was</p>
<p>opened, and Mr. Kirwin entered. His countenance</p>
<p>expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a</p>
<p>chair close to mine, and addressed me in French —</p>
<p>“I fear that this place is very shocking to you;</p>
<p>can I do any thing to make you more comfortable?”</p>
<p>“I thank you; but all that you mention is nothing</p>
<p>to me: on the whole earth there is no comfort which</p>
<p>I am capable of receiving.”</p>
<p>“I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be</p>
<p>but of little relief to one borne down as you are by</p>
<p>so strange a misfortune. But you will, I hope, soon</p>
<p>quit this melancholy abode; for, doubtless, evidence</p>
<p>can easily be brought to free you from the criminal</p>
<p>charge.”</p>
<p>“That is my least concern: I am, by a course</p>
<p>of strange events, become the most miserable of</p>
<p>mortals. Persecuted and tortured as I am and have</p>
<p>been, can death be any evil to me?”</p>
<p>“Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and</p>
<p>agonizing than the strange chances that have lately</p>
<p>occurred. You were thrown, by some surprising</p>
<p>accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality:</p>
<p>seized immediately, and charged with murder. The</p>
<p>ﬁrst sight that was presented to your eyes was the</p>
<p>body of your friend, murdered in so unaccountable</p>
<p>a manner, and placed, as it were, by some ﬁend</p>
<p>across your path.”</p>
<p>As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agi-</p>
<p>tation I endured on this retrospect of my sufferings,</p>
<p>I also felt considerable surprise at the knowledge</p>
<p>he seemed to possess concerning me. I suppose</p>
<p>some astonishment was exhibited in my counte-</p>
<p>nance; for Mr. Kirwin hastened to say —</p>
<p>“It was not until a day or two after your illness</p>
<p>that I thought of examining your dress, that I might</p>
<p>discover some trace by which I could send to your</p>
<p>relations an account of your misfortune and illness.</p>
<p>I found several letters, and, among others, one</p>
<p>which I discovered from its commencement to be</p>
<p>from your father. I instantly wrote to Geneva: nearly</p>
<p>two months have elapsed since the departure of</p>
<p>my letter. — But you are ill; even now you tremble:</p>
<p>you are unﬁt for agitation of any kind.”</p>
<p>“This suspense is a thousand times worse than</p>
<p>the most horrible event: tell me what new scene of</p>
<p>death has been acted, and whose murder I am now</p>
<p>to lament.”</p>
<p>“Your family is perfectly well,” said Mr. Kirwin,</p>
<p>with gentleness; “and some one, a friend, is come</p>
<p>to visit you.”</p>
<p>I know not by what chain of thought the idea</p>
<p>presented itself, but it instantly darted into my mind</p>
<p>that the murderer had come to mock at my misery,</p>
<p>and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new</p>
<p>incitement for me to comply with his hellish desires.</p>
<p>I put my hand before my eyes, and cried out in</p>
<p>agony —</p>
<p>“Oh! take him away! I cannot see him; for God’s</p>
<p>sake, do not let him enter!”</p>
<p>Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled counte-</p>
<p>nance. He could not help regarding my exclamation</p>
<p>as a presumption of my guilt, and said, in rather a</p>
<p>severe tone —</p>
<p>“I should have thought, young man, that the</p>
<p>presence of your father would have been welcome,</p>
<p>instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.”</p>
<p>“My father!” cried I, while every feature and</p>
<p>every muscle was relaxed from anguish to pleasure.</p>
<p>“Is my father, indeed, come? How kind, how very</p>
<p>kind. But where is he, why does he not hasten to</p>
<p>me?”</p>
<p>My change of manner surprised and pleased</p>
<p>the magistrate; perhaps he thought that my former</p>
<p>exclamation was a momentary return of delirium,</p>
<p>and now he instantly resumed his former benevo-</p>
<p>lence. He rose, and quitted the room with my nurse,</p>
<p>and in a moment my father entered it.</p>
<p>Nothing, at this moment, could have given me</p>
<p>greater pleasure than the arrival of my father. I</p>
<p>stretched out my hand to him, and cried —</p>
<p>“Are you then safe — and Elizabeth — and</p>
<p>Ernest?”</p>
<p>My father calmed me with assurances of their</p>
<p>welfare, and endeavoured, by dwelling on these</p>
<p>subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my</p>
<p>desponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison</p>
<p>cannot be the abode of cheerfulness. “What a place</p>
<p>is this that you inhabit, my son!” said he, looking</p>
<p>mournfully at the barred windows, and wretched</p>
<p>appearance of the room. “You travelled to seek</p>
<p>happiness, but a fatality seems to pursue you. And</p>
<p>poor Clerval — ”</p>
<p>The name of my unfortunate and murdered</p>
<p>friend was an agitation too great to be endured</p>
<p>in my weak state; I shed tears.</p>
<p>“Alas! yes, my father,” replied I; “some destiny</p>
<p>of the most horrible kind hangs over me, and I must</p>
<p>live to fulﬁl it, or surely I should have died on the</p>
<p>cofﬁn of Henry.”</p>
<p>We were not allowed to converse for any length</p>
<p>of time, for the precarious state of my health ren-</p>
<p>dered every precaution necessary that could insure</p>
<p>tranquillity. Mr. Kirwin came in, and insisted that my</p>
<p>strength should not be exhausted by too much exer-</p>
<p>tion. But the appearance of my father was to me like</p>
<p>that of my good angel, and I gradually recovered</p>
<p>my health.</p>
<p>As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by</p>
<p>a gloomy and black melancholy, that nothing could</p>
<p>dissipate. The image of Clerval was for ever be-</p>
<p>fore me, ghastly and murdered. More than once</p>
<p>the agitation into which these reﬂections threw me</p>
<p>made my friends dread a dangerous relapse. Alas!</p>
<p>why did they preserve so miserable and detested</p>
<p>a life? It was surely that I might fulﬁl my destiny,</p>
<p>which is now drawing to a close. Soon, oh, very</p>
<p>soon, will death extinguish these throbbings, and</p>
<p>relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that</p>
<p>bears me to the dust; and, in executing the award</p>
<p>of justice, I shall also sink to rest. Then the ap-</p>
<p>pearance of death was distant, although the wish</p>
<p>was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat</p>
<p>for hours motionless and speechless, wishing for</p>
<p>some mighty revolution that might bury me and my</p>
<p>destroyer in its ruins.</p>
<p>The season of the assizes approached. I had</p>
<p>already been three months in prison; and although I</p>
<p>was still weak, and in continual danger of a relapse,</p>
<p>I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the</p>
<p>county-town, where the court was held. Mr. Kirwin</p>
<p>charged himself with every care of collecting wit-</p>
<p>nesses, and arranging my defence. I was spared</p>
<p>the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as</p>
<p>the case was not brought before the court that de-</p>
<p>cides on life and death. The grand jury rejected the</p>
<p>bill, on its being proved that I was on the Orkney</p>
<p>Islands at the hour the body of my friend was found,</p>
<p>and a fortnight after my removal I was liberated</p>
<p>from prison.</p>
<p>My father was enraptured on ﬁnding me freed</p>
<p>from the vexations of a criminal charge, that I was</p>
<p>again allowed to breathe the fresh atmosphere, and</p>
<p>allowed to return to my native country. I did not par-</p>
<p>ticipate in these feelings; for to me the walls of a</p>
<p>dungeon or a palace were alike hateful. The cup</p>
<p>of life was poisoned for ever; and although the sun</p>
<p>shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of</p>
<p>heart, I saw around me nothing but a dense and</p>
<p>frightful darkness, penetrated by no light but the</p>
<p>glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me. Some-</p>
<p>times they were the expressive eyes of Henry, lan-</p>
<p>guishing in death, the dark orbs nearly covered</p>
<p>by the lids, and the long black lashes that fringed</p>
<p>them; sometimes it was the watery clouded eyes of</p>
<p>the monster, as I ﬁrst saw them in my chamber at</p>
<p>Ingolstadt.</p>
<p>My father tried to awaken in me the feelings</p>
<p>of affection. He talked of Geneva, which I should</p>
<p>soon visit — of Elizabeth, and Ernest; but these</p>
<p>words only drew deep groans from me. Sometimes,</p>
<p>indeed, I felt a wish for happiness; and thought,</p>
<p>with melancholy delight, of my beloved cousin; or</p>
<p>longed, with a devouring maladie du pays, to see</p>
<p>once more the blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had</p>
<p>been so dear to me in early childhood: but my gen-</p>
<p>eral state of feeling was a torpor, in which a prison</p>
<p>was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene</p>
<p>in nature; and these ﬁts were seldom interrupted,</p>
<p>but by paroxysms of anguish and despair. At these</p>
<p>moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the</p>
<p>existence I loathed; and it required unceasing atten-</p>
<p>dance and vigilance to restrain me from committing</p>
<p>some dreadful act of violence.</p>
<p>I remember, as I quitted the prison, I heard</p>
<p>one of the men say, “He may be innocent of the</p>
<p>murder, but he has certainly a bad conscience.”</p>
<p>These words struck me. A bad conscience! yes,</p>
<p>surely I had one. William, Justine, and Clerval, had</p>
<p>died through my infernal machinations; “And whose</p>
<p>death,” cried I, “is to ﬁnish the tragedy? Ah! my</p>
<p>father, do not remain in this wretched country; take</p>
<p>me where I may forget myself, my existence, and</p>
<p>all the world.”</p>
<p>My father easily acceded to my desire; and,</p>
<p>after having taken leave of Mr. Kirwin, we hastened</p>
<p>to Dublin. I felt as if I was relieved from a heavy</p>
<p>weight, when the packet sailed with a fair wind from</p>
<p>Ireland, and I had quitted for ever the country which</p>
<p>had been to me the scene of so much misery.</p>
<p>It was midnight. My father slept in the cabin; and</p>
<p>I lay on the deck, looking at the stars, and listening</p>
<p>to the dashing of the waves. I hailed the darkness</p>
<p>that shut Ireland from my sight, and my pulse beat</p>
<p>with a feverish joy, when I reﬂected that I should</p>
<p>soon see Geneva. The past appeared to me in the</p>
<p>light of a frightful dream; yet the vessel in which I</p>
<p>was, the wind that blew me from the detested shore</p>
<p>of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told</p>
<p>me too forcibly that I was deceived by no vision,</p>
<p>and that Clerval, my friend and dearest companion,</p>
<p>had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my</p>
<p>creation. I repassed, in my memory, my whole life;</p>
<p>my quiet happiness while residing with my family in</p>
<p>Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure</p>
<p>for Ingolstadt. I remembered shuddering at the mad</p>
<p>enthusiasm that hurried me on to the creation of</p>
<p>my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night</p>
<p>during which he ﬁrst lived. I was unable to pursue</p>
<p>the train of thought; a thousand feelings pressed</p>
<p>upon me, and I wept bitterly.</p>
<p>Ever since my recovery from the fever I had</p>
<p>been in the custom of taking every night a small</p>
<p>quantity of laudanum; for it was by means of this</p>
<p>drug only that I was enabled to gain the rest nec-</p>
<p>essary for the preservation of life. Oppressed by</p>
<p>the recollection of my various misfortunes, I now</p>
<p>took a double dose, and soon slept profoundly. But</p>
<p>sleep did not afford me respite from thought and</p>
<p>misery; my dreams presented a thousand objects</p>
<p>that scared me. Towards morning I was possessed</p>
<p>by a kind of night-mare; I felt the ﬁend’s grasp in my</p>
<p>neck, and could not free myself from it; groans and</p>
<p>cries rung in my ears. My father, who was watching</p>
<p>over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me,</p>
<p>and pointed to the port of Holyhead, which we were</p>
<p>now entering.</p>
<p>Chapter V</p>
<p>WE had resolved not to go to London, but to cross</p>
<p>the country to Portsmouth, and thence to embark</p>
<p>for Havre. I preferred this plan principally because</p>
<p>I dreaded to see again those places in which I</p>
<p>had enjoyed a few moments of tranquillity with my</p>
<p>beloved Clerval. I thought with horror of seeing</p>
<p>again those persons whom we had been accus-</p>
<p>tomed to visit together, and who might make in-</p>
<p>quiries concerning an event, the very remembrance</p>
<p>of which made me again feel the pang I endured</p>
<p>when I gazed on his lifeless form in the inn at ——.</p>
<p>338</p>
<p>As for my father, his desires and exertions were</p>
<p>bounded to the again seeing me restored to health</p>
<p>and peace of mind. His tenderness and attentions</p>
<p>were unremitting; my grief and gloom was obstinate,</p>
<p>but he would not despair. Sometimes he thought</p>
<p>that I felt deeply the degradation of being obliged</p>
<p>to answer a charge of murder, and he endeavoured</p>
<p>to prove to me the futility of pride.</p>
<p>“Alas! my father,” said I, “how little do you know</p>
<p>me. Human beings, their feelings and passions,</p>
<p>would indeed be degraded, if such a wretch as I</p>
<p>felt pride. Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as</p>
<p>innocent as I, and she suffered the same charge;</p>
<p>she died for it; and I am the cause of this — I</p>
<p>murdered her. William, Justine, and Henry — they</p>
<p>all died by my hands.”</p>
<p>My father had often, during my imprisonment,</p>
<p>heard me make the same assertion; when I thus</p>
<p>accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire</p>
<p>an explanation, and at others he appeared to con-</p>
<p>sider it as caused by delirium, and that, during my</p>
<p>illness, some idea of this kind had presented itself</p>
<p>to my imagination, the remembrance of which I pre-</p>
<p>served in my convalescence. I avoided explanation,</p>
<p>and maintained a continual silence concerning the</p>
<p>wretch I had created. I had a feeling that I should</p>
<p>be supposed mad, and this for ever chained my</p>
<p>tongue, when I would have given the whole world</p>
<p>to have conﬁded the fatal secret.</p>
<p>Upon this occasion my father said, with an</p>
<p>expression of unbounded wonder, “What do you</p>
<p>mean, Victor? are you mad? My dear son, I entreat</p>
<p>you never to make such an assertion again.”</p>
<p>“I am not mad,” I cried energetically; “the sun</p>
<p>and the heavens, who have viewed my operations,</p>
<p>can bear witness of my truth. I am the assassin</p>
<p>of those most innocent victims; they died by my</p>
<p>machinations. A thousand times would I have shed</p>
<p>my own blood, drop by drop, to have saved their</p>
<p>lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not</p>
<p>sacriﬁce the whole human race.”</p>
<p>The conclusion of this speech convinced my fa-</p>
<p>ther that my ideas were deranged, and he instantly</p>
<p>changed the subject of our conversation, and en-</p>
<p>deavoured to alter the course of my thoughts. He</p>
<p>wished as much as possible to obliterate the mem-</p>
<p>ory of the scenes that had taken place in Ireland,</p>
<p>and never alluded to them, or suffered me to speak</p>
<p>of my misfortunes.</p>
<p>As time passed away I became more calm: mis-</p>
<p>ery had her dwelling in my heart, but I no longer</p>
<p>talked in the same incoherent manner of my own</p>
<p>crimes; sufﬁcient for me was the consciousness</p>
<p>of them. By the utmost self-violence, I curbed the</p>
<p>imperious voice of wretchedness, which sometimes</p>
<p>desired to declare itself to the whole world; and my</p>
<p>manners were calmer and more composed than</p>
<p>they had ever been since my journey to the sea of</p>
<p>ice.</p>
<p>We arrived at Havre on the 8th of May, and</p>
<p>instantly proceeded to Paris, where my father had</p>
<p>some business which detained us a few weeks.</p>
<p>In this city, I received the following letter from</p>
<p>Elizabeth:—</p>
<p>“To VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN.</p>
<p>“MY DEAREST FRIEND,</p>
<p>“It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive</p>
<p>a letter from my uncle dated at Paris; you are no</p>
<p>longer at a formidable distance, and I may hope to</p>
<p>see you in less than a fortnight. My poor cousin,</p>
<p>how much you must have suffered! I expect to see</p>
<p>you looking even more ill than when you quitted</p>
<p>Geneva. This winter has been passed most miser-</p>
<p>ably, tortured as I have been by anxious suspense;</p>
<p>yet I hope to see peace in your countenance, and</p>
<p>to ﬁnd that your heart is not totally devoid of comfort</p>
<p>and tranquillity.</p>
<p>“Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that</p>
<p>made you so miserable a year ago, even perhaps</p>
<p>augmented by time. I would not disturb you at</p>
<p>this period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon</p>
<p>you; but a conversation that I had with my uncle</p>
<p>previous to his departure renders some explanation</p>
<p>necessary before we meet.</p>
<p>“Explanation! you may possibly say; what can</p>
<p>Elizabeth have to explain? If you really say this, my</p>
<p>questions are answered, and I have no more to do</p>
<p>than to sign myself your affectionate cousin. But</p>
<p>you are distant from me, and it is possible that you</p>
<p>may dread, and yet be pleased with this explana-</p>
<p>tion; and, in a probability of this being the case, I</p>
<p>dare not any longer postpone writing what, during</p>
<p>your absence, I have often wished to express to</p>
<p>you, but have never had the courage to begin.</p>
<p>“You well know, Victor, that our union had been</p>
<p>the favourite plan of your parents ever since our</p>
<p>infancy. We were told this when young, and taught</p>
<p>to look forward to it as an event that would certainly</p>
<p>take place. We were affectionate playfellows during</p>
<p>childhood, and, I believe, dear and valued friends to</p>
<p>one another as we grew older. But as brother and</p>
<p>sister often entertain a lively affection towards each</p>
<p>other, without desiring a more intimate union, may</p>
<p>not such also be our case? Tell me, dearest Victor.</p>
<p>Answer me, I conjure you, by our mutual happiness,</p>
<p>with simple truth — Do you not love another?</p>
<p>“You have travelled; you have spent several</p>
<p>years of your life at Ingolstadt; and I confess to</p>
<p>you, my friend, that when I saw you last autumn so</p>
<p>unhappy, ﬂying to solitude, from the society of every</p>
<p>creature, I could not help supposing that you might</p>
<p>regret our connexion, and believe yourself bound in</p>
<p>honour to fulﬁl the wishes of your parents, although</p>
<p>they opposed themselves to your inclinations. But</p>
<p>this is false reasoning. I confess to you, my cousin,</p>
<p>that I love you, and that in my airy dreams of futurity</p>
<p>you have been my constant friend and compan-</p>
<p>ion. But it is your happiness I desire as well as</p>
<p>my own, when I declare to you, that our marriage</p>
<p>would render me eternally miserable, unless it were</p>
<p>the dictate of your own free choice. Even now I</p>
<p>weep to think, that, borne down as you are by the</p>
<p>cruelest misfortunes, you may stiﬂe, by the word</p>
<p>honour, all hope of that love and happiness which</p>
<p>would alone restore you to yourself. I, who have</p>
<p>so interested an affection for you, may increase</p>
<p>your miseries ten-fold, by being an obstacle to your</p>
<p>wishes. Ah, Victor, be assured that your cousin</p>
<p>and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to</p>
<p>be made miserable by this supposition. Be happy,</p>
<p>my friend; and if you obey me in this one request,</p>
<p>remain satisﬁed that nothing on earth will have the</p>
<p>power to interrupt my tranquillity.</p>
<p>“Do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer</p>
<p>it to-morrow, or the next day, or even until you come,</p>
<p>if it will give you pain. My uncle will send me news</p>
<p>of your health; and if I see but one smile on your</p>
<p>lips when we meet, occasioned by this or any other</p>
<p>exertion of mine, I shall need no other happiness.</p>
<p>“ELIZABETH LAVENZA.</p>
<p>“Geneva, May 18th, 17— .”</p>
<p>This letter revived in my memory what I had</p>
<p>before forgotten, the threat of the ﬁend — “I will</p>
<p>be with you on your wedding-night!” Such was my</p>
<p>sentence, and on that night would the dæmon em-</p>
<p>ploy every art to destroy me, and tear me from the</p>
<p>glimpse of happiness which promised partly to con-</p>
<p>sole my sufferings. On that night he had determined</p>
<p>to consummate his crimes by my death. Well, be</p>
<p>it so; a deadly struggle would then assuredly take</p>
<p>place, in which if he was victorious, I should be at</p>
<p>peace, and his power over me be at an end. If he</p>
<p>were vanquished, I should be a free man. Alas!</p>
<p>what freedom? such as the peasant enjoys when</p>
<p>his family have been massacred before his eyes,</p>
<p>his cottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is</p>
<p>turned adrift, homeless, pennyless, and alone, but</p>
<p>free. Such would be my liberty, except that in my</p>
<p>Elizabeth I possessed a treasure; alas! balanced</p>
<p>by those horrors of remorse and guilt, which would</p>
<p>pursue me until death.</p>
<p>Sweet and beloved Elizabeth! I read and re-</p>
<p>read her letter, and some softened feelings stole</p>
<p>into my heart, and dared to whisper paradisaical</p>
<p>dreams of love and joy; but the apple was already</p>
<p>eaten, and the angel’s arm bared to drive me from</p>
<p>all hope. Yet I would die to make her happy. If the</p>
<p>monster executed his threat, death was inevitable;</p>
<p>yet, again, I considered whether my marriage would</p>
<p>hasten my fate. My destruction might indeed arrive</p>
<p>a few months sooner; but if my torturer should sus-</p>
<p>pect that I postponed it, inﬂuenced by his menaces,</p>
<p>he would surely ﬁnd other, and perhaps more dread-</p>
<p>ful means of revenge. He had vowed to be with me</p>
<p>on my wedding-night, yet he did not consider that</p>
<p>threat as binding him to peace in the mean time; for,</p>
<p>as if to shew me that he was not yet satiated with</p>
<p>blood, he had murdered Clerval immediately after</p>
<p>the enunciation of his threats. I resolved, therefore,</p>
<p>that if my immediate union with my cousin would</p>
<p>conduce either to her’s or my father’s happiness,</p>
<p>my adversary’s designs against my life should not</p>
<p>retard it a single hour.</p>
<p>In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth. My</p>
<p>letter was calm and affectionate. “I fear, my beloved</p>
<p>girl,” I said, “little happiness remains for us on earth;</p>
<p>yet all that I may one day enjoy is concentered in</p>
<p>you. Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do</p>
<p>I consecrate my life, and my endeavours for con-</p>
<p>tentment. I have one secret, Elizabeth, a dreadful</p>
<p>one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame</p>
<p>with horror, and then, far from being surprised at</p>
<p>my misery, you will only wonder that I survive what</p>
<p>I have endured. I will conﬁde this tale of misery and</p>
<p>terror to you the day after our marriage shall take</p>
<p>place; for, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect</p>
<p>conﬁdence between us. But until then, I conjure</p>
<p>you, do not mention or allude to it. This I most</p>
<p>earnestly entreat, and I know you will comply.”</p>
<p>In about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth’s</p>
<p>letter, we returned to Geneva. My cousin welcomed</p>
<p>me with warm affection; yet tears were in her eyes,</p>
<p>as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish</p>
<p>cheeks. I saw a change in her also. She was</p>
<p>thinner, and had lost much of that heavenly vivacity</p>
<p>that had before charmed me; but her gentleness,</p>
<p>and soft looks of compassion, made her a more ﬁt</p>
<p>companion for one blasted and miserable as I was.</p>
<p>The tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not en-</p>
<p>dure. Memory brought madness with it; and when</p>
<p>I thought on what had passed, a real insanity pos-</p>
<p>sessed me; sometimes I was furious, and burnt</p>
<p>with rage, sometimes low and despondent. I nei-</p>
<p>ther spoke or looked, but sat motionless, bewildered</p>
<p>by the multitude of miseries that overcame me.</p>
<p>Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from</p>
<p>these ﬁts; her gentle voice would soothe me when</p>
<p>transported by passion, and inspire me with hu-</p>
<p>man feelings when sunk in torpor. She wept with</p>
<p>me, and for me. When reason returned, she would</p>
<p>remonstrate, and endeavour to inspire me with res-</p>
<p>ignation. Ah! it is well for the unfortunate to be</p>
<p>resigned, but for the guilty there is no peace. The</p>
<p>agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is oth-</p>
<p>erwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of</p>
<p>grief.</p>
<p>Soon after my arrival my father spoke of my</p>
<p>immediate marriage with my cousin. I remained</p>
<p>silent.</p>
<p>“Have you, then, some other attachment?”</p>
<p>“None on earth. I love Elizabeth, and look for-</p>
<p>ward to our union with delight. Let the day therefore</p>
<p>be ﬁxed; and on it I will consecrate myself, in life or</p>
<p>death, to the happiness of my cousin.”</p>
<p>“My dear Victor, do not speak thus. Heavy mis-</p>
<p>fortunes have befallen us; but let us only cling closer</p>
<p>to what remains, and transfer our love for those</p>
<p>whom we have lost to those who yet live. Our circle</p>
<p>will be small, but bound close by the ties of affec-</p>
<p>tion and mutual misfortune. And when time shall</p>
<p>have softened your despair, new and dear objects</p>
<p>of care will be born to replace those of whom we</p>
<p>have been so cruelly deprived.”</p>
<p>Such were the lessons of my father. But to</p>
<p>me the remembrance of the threat returned: nor</p>
<p>can you wonder, that, omnipotent as the ﬁend had</p>
<p>yet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost</p>
<p>regard him as invincible; and that when he had pro-</p>
<p>nounced the words, “I shall be with you on your</p>
<p>wedding-night,” I should regard the threatened fate</p>
<p>as unavoidable. But death was no evil to me, if</p>
<p>the loss of Elizabeth were balanced with it; and I</p>
<p>therefore, with a contented and even cheerful coun-</p>
<p>tenance, agreed with my father, that if my cousin</p>
<p>would consent, the ceremony should take place in</p>
<p>ten days, and thus put, as I imagined, the seal to</p>
<p>my fate.</p>
<p>Great God! if for one instant I had thought what</p>
<p>might be the hellish intention of my ﬁendish adver-</p>
<p>sary, I would rather have banished myself for ever</p>
<p>from my native country, and wandered a friendless</p>
<p>outcast over the earth, than have consented to this</p>
<p>miserable marriage. But, as if possessed of magic</p>
<p>powers, the monster had blinded me to his real in-</p>
<p>tentions; and when I thought that I prepared only</p>
<p>my own death, I hastened that of a far dearer victim.</p>
<p>As the period ﬁxed for our marriage drew nearer,</p>
<p>whether from cowardice or a prophetic feeling, I</p>
<p>felt my heart sink within me. But I concealed my</p>
<p>feelings by an appearance of hilarity, that brought</p>
<p>smiles and joy to the countenance of my father,</p>
<p>but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer</p>
<p>eye of Elizabeth. She looked forward to our union</p>
<p>with placid contentment, not unmingled with a little</p>
<p>fear, which past misfortunes had impressed, that</p>
<p>what now appeared certain and tangible happiness,</p>
<p>might soon dissipate into an airy dream, and leave</p>
<p>no trace but deep and everlasting regret.</p>
<p>Preparations were made for the event; congrat-</p>
<p>ulatory visits were received; and all wore a smiling</p>
<p>appearance. I shut up, as well as I could, in my</p>
<p>own heart the anxiety that preyed there, and en-</p>
<p>tered with seeming earnestness into the plans of</p>
<p>my father, although they might only serve as the</p>
<p>decorations of my tragedy. A house was purchased</p>
<p>for us near Cologny, by which we should enjoy the</p>
<p>pleasures of the country, and yet be so near Geneva</p>
<p>as to see my father every day; who would still reside</p>
<p>within the walls, for the beneﬁt of Ernest, that he</p>
<p>might follow his studies at the schools.</p>
<p>In the mean time I took every precaution to de-</p>
<p>fend my person, in case the ﬁend should openly</p>
<p>attack me. I carried pistols and a dagger constantly</p>
<p>about me, and was ever on the watch to prevent ar-</p>
<p>tiﬁce; and by these means gained a greater degree</p>
<p>of tranquillity. Indeed, as the period approached,</p>
<p>the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to</p>
<p>be regarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while</p>
<p>the happiness I hoped for in my marriage wore a</p>
<p>greater appearance of certainty, as the day ﬁxed for</p>
<p>its solemnization drew nearer, and I heard it contin-</p>
<p>ually spoken of as an occurrence which no accident</p>
<p>could possibly prevent.</p>
<p>Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil dem-</p>
<p>eanour contributed greatly to calm her mind. But on</p>
<p>the day that was to fulﬁl my wishes and my destiny,</p>
<p>she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil</p>
<p>pervaded her; and perhaps also she thought of the</p>
<p>dreadful secret, which I had promised to reveal to</p>
<p>her the following day. My father was in the mean</p>
<p>time overjoyed, and, in the bustle of preparation,</p>
<p>only observed in the melancholy of his niece the</p>
<p>difﬁdence of a bride.</p>
<p>After the ceremony was performed, a large</p>
<p>party assembled at my father’s; but it was agreed</p>
<p>that Elizabeth and I should pass the afternoon and</p>
<p>night at Evian, and return to Cologny the next morn-</p>
<p>ing. As the day was fair, and the wind favourable,</p>
<p>we resolved to go by water.</p>
<p>Those were the last moments of my life dur-</p>
<p>ing which I enjoyed the feeling of happiness. We</p>
<p>passed rapidly along: the sun was hot, but we were</p>
<p>sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy, while we</p>
<p>enjoyed the beauty of the scene, sometimes on one</p>
<p>side of the lake, where we saw Mont Salêve, the</p>
<p>pleasant banks of Montalêgre, and at a distance,</p>
<p>surmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blânc, and the</p>
<p>assemblage of snowy mountains that in vain en-</p>
<p>deavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the</p>
<p>opposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing</p>
<p>its dark side to the ambition that would quit its na-</p>
<p>tive country, and an almost insurmountable barrier</p>
<p>to the invader who should wish to enslave it.</p>
<p>I took the hand of Elizabeth: “You are sorrowful,</p>
<p>my love. Ah! if you knew what I have suffered, and</p>
<p>what I may yet endure, you would endeavour to let</p>
<p>me taste the quiet, and freedom from despair, that</p>
<p>this one day at least permits me to enjoy.”</p>
<p>“Be happy, my dear Victor,” replied Elizabeth;</p>
<p>“there is, I hope, nothing to distress you; and be</p>
<p>assured that if a lively joy is not painted in my face,</p>
<p>my heart is contented. Something whispers to me</p>
<p>not to depend too much on the prospect that is</p>
<p>opened before us; but I will not listen to such a</p>
<p>sinister voice. Observe how fast we move along,</p>
<p>and how the clouds which sometimes obscure, and</p>
<p>sometimes rise above the dome of Mont Blânc,</p>
<p>render this scene of beauty still more interesting.</p>
<p>Look also at the innumerable ﬁsh that are swimming</p>
<p>in the clear waters, where we can distinguish every</p>
<p>pebble that lies at the bottom. What a divine day!</p>
<p>how happy and serene all nature appears!”</p>
<p>Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her th-</p>
<p>oughts and mine from all reﬂection upon melan-</p>
<p>choly subjects. But her temper was ﬂuctuating; joy</p>
<p>for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continu-</p>
<p>ally gave place to distraction and reverie.</p>
<p>The sun sunk lower in the heavens; we passed</p>
<p>the river Drance, and observed its path through the</p>
<p>chasms of the higher, and the glens of the lower</p>
<p>hills. The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we</p>
<p>approached the amphitheatre of mountains which</p>
<p>forms its eastern boundary. The spire of Evian</p>
<p>shone under the woods that surrounded it, and the</p>
<p>range of mountain above mountain by which it was</p>
<p>overhung.</p>
<p>The wind, which had hitherto carried us along</p>
<p>with amazing rapidity, sunk at sunset to a light</p>
<p>breeze; the soft air just rufﬂed the water, and</p>
<p>caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we</p>
<p>approached the shore, from which it wafted the</p>
<p>most delightful scent of ﬂowers and hay. The sun</p>
<p>sunk beneath the horizon as we landed; and as</p>
<p>I touched the shore, I felt those cares and fears</p>
<p>revive, which soon were to clasp me, and cling to</p>
<p>me for ever.</p>
<p>Chapter VI</p>
<p>IT was eight o’clock when we landed; we walked for</p>
<p>a short time on the shore, enjoying the transitory</p>
<p>light, and then retired to the inn, and contemplated</p>
<p>the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains,</p>
<p>obscured in darkness, yet still displaying their black</p>
<p>outlines.</p>
<p>The wind, which had fallen in the south, now</p>
<p>rose with great violence in the west. The moon</p>
<p>had reached her summit in the heavens, and was</p>
<p>beginning to descend; the clouds swept across it</p>
<p>swifter than the ﬂight of the vulture, and dimmed</p>
<p>her rays, while the lake reﬂected the scene of the</p>
<p>357</p>
<p>busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless</p>
<p>waves that were beginning to rise. Suddenly a</p>
<p>heavy storm of rain descended.</p>
<p>I had been calm during the day; but so soon as</p>
<p>night obscured the shapes of objects, a thousand</p>
<p>fears arose in my mind. I was anxious and watchful,</p>
<p>while my right hand grasped a pistol which was</p>
<p>hidden in my bosom; every sound terriﬁed me; but</p>
<p>I resolved that I would sell my life dearly, and not</p>
<p>relax the impending conﬂict until my own life, or that</p>
<p>of my adversary, were extinguished.</p>
<p>Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time</p>
<p>in timid and fearful silence; at length she said,</p>
<p>“What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor? What</p>
<p>is it you fear?”</p>
<p>“Oh! peace, peace, my love,” replied I, “this</p>
<p>night, and all will be safe: but this night is dreadful,</p>
<p>very dreadful.”</p>
<p>I passed an hour in this state of mind, when</p>
<p>suddenly I reﬂected how dreadful the combat which</p>
<p>I momentarily expected would be to my wife, and</p>
<p>I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to</p>
<p>join her until I had obtained some knowledge as to</p>
<p>the situation of my enemy.</p>
<p>She left me, and I continued some time walking</p>
<p>up and down the passages of the house, and in-</p>
<p>specting every corner that might afford a retreat to</p>
<p>my adversary. But I discovered no trace of him, and</p>
<p>was beginning to conjecture that some fortunate</p>
<p>chance had intervened to prevent the execution of</p>
<p>his menaces; when suddenly I heard a shrill and</p>
<p>dreadful scream. It came from the room into which</p>
<p>Elizabeth had retired. As I heard it, the whole truth</p>
<p>rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the motion</p>
<p>of every muscle and ﬁbre was suspended; I could</p>
<p>feel the blood trickling in my veins, and tingling in</p>
<p>the extremities of my limbs. This state lasted but for</p>
<p>an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed</p>
<p>into the room.</p>
<p>Great God! why did I not then expire! Why am I</p>
<p>here to relate the destruction of the best hope, and</p>
<p>the purest creature of earth. She was there, lifeless</p>
<p>and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head</p>
<p>hanging down, and her pale and distorted features</p>
<p>half covered by her hair. Every where I turn I see</p>
<p>the same ﬁgure — her bloodless arms and relaxed</p>
<p>form ﬂung by the murderer on its bridal bier. Could</p>
<p>I behold this, and live? Alas! life is obstinate, and</p>
<p>clings closest where it is most hated. For a moment</p>
<p>only did I lose recollection; I fainted.</p>
<p>When I recovered, I found myself surrounded</p>
<p>by the people of the inn; their countenances ex-</p>
<p>pressed a breathless terror: but the horror of others</p>
<p>appeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feel-</p>
<p>ings that oppressed me. I escaped from them to the</p>
<p>room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my</p>
<p>wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy. She had</p>
<p>been moved from the posture in which I had ﬁrst</p>
<p>beheld her; and now, as she lay, her head upon her</p>
<p>arm, and a handkerchief thrown across her face and</p>
<p>neck, I might have supposed her asleep. I rushed</p>
<p>towards her, and embraced her with ardour; but the</p>
<p>deathly languor and coldness of the limbs told me,</p>
<p>that what I now held in my arms had ceased to be</p>
<p>the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished. The</p>
<p>murderous mark of the ﬁend’s grasp was on her</p>
<p>neck, and the breath had ceased to issue from her</p>
<p>lips.</p>
<p>While I still hung over her in the agony of de-</p>
<p>spair, I happened to look up. The windows of the</p>
<p>room had before been darkened; and I felt a kind</p>
<p>of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon</p>
<p>illuminate the chamber. The shutters had been</p>
<p>thrown back; and, with a sensation of horror not to</p>
<p>be described, I saw at the open window a ﬁgure</p>
<p>the most hideous and abhorred. A grin was on the</p>
<p>face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with</p>
<p>his ﬁendish ﬁnger he pointed towards the corpse of</p>
<p>my wife. I rushed towards the window, and draw-</p>
<p>ing a pistol from my bosom, shot; but he eluded</p>
<p>me, leaped from his station, and, running with the</p>
<p>swiftness of lightning, plunged into the lake.</p>
<p>The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the</p>
<p>room. I pointed to the spot where he had disap-</p>
<p>peared, and we followed the track with boats; nets</p>
<p>were cast, but in vain. After passing several hours,</p>
<p>we returned hopeless, most of my companions be-</p>
<p>lieving it to have been a form conjured by my fancy.</p>
<p>After having landed, they proceeded to search the</p>
<p>country, parties going in different directions among</p>
<p>the woods and vines.</p>
<p>I did not accompany them; I was exhausted: a</p>
<p>ﬁlm covered my eyes, and my skin was parched</p>
<p>with the heat of fever. In this state I lay on a bed,</p>
<p>hardly conscious of what had happened; my eyes</p>
<p>wandered round the room, as if to seek something</p>
<p>that I had lost.</p>
<p>At length I remembered that my father would</p>
<p>anxiously expect the return of Elizabeth and myself,</p>
<p>and that I must return alone. This reﬂection brought</p>
<p>tears into my eyes, and I wept for a long time; but my</p>
<p>thoughts rambled to various subjects, reﬂecting on</p>
<p>my misfortunes, and their cause. I was bewildered</p>
<p>in a cloud of wonder and horror. The death of</p>
<p>William, the execution of Justine, the murder of</p>
<p>Clerval, and lastly of my wife; even at that moment</p>
<p>I knew not that my only remaining friends were safe</p>
<p>from the malignity of the ﬁend; my father even now</p>
<p>might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might</p>
<p>be dead at his feet. This idea made me shudder,</p>
<p>and recalled me to action. I started up, and resolved</p>
<p>to return to Geneva with all possible speed.</p>
<p>There were no horses to be procured, and</p>
<p>I must return by the lake; but the wind was un-</p>
<p>favourable, and the rain fell in torrents. However, it</p>
<p>was hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope</p>
<p>to arrive by night. I hired men to row, and took</p>
<p>an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief</p>
<p>from mental torment in bodily exercise. But the</p>
<p>overﬂowing misery I now felt, and the excess of</p>
<p>agitation that I endured, rendered me incapable of</p>
<p>any exertion. I threw down the oar; and, leaning my</p>
<p>head upon my hands, gave way to every gloomy</p>
<p>idea that arose. If I looked up, I saw the scenes</p>
<p>which were familiar to me in my happier time, and</p>
<p>which I had contemplated but the day before in the</p>
<p>company of her who was now but a shadow and a</p>
<p>recollection. Tears streamed from my eyes. The</p>
<p>rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw the ﬁsh</p>
<p>play in the waters as they had done a few hours</p>
<p>before; they had then been observed by Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great</p>
<p>and sudden change. The sun might shine, or the</p>
<p>clouds might lour; but nothing could appear to</p>
<p>me as it had done the day before. A ﬁend had</p>
<p>snatched from me every hope of future happiness:</p>
<p>no creature had ever been so miserable as I was;</p>
<p>so frightful an event is single in the history of man.</p>
<p>But why should I dwell upon the incidents</p>
<p>that followed this last overwhelming event. Mine</p>
<p>has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their</p>
<p>acme, and what I must now relate can but be te-</p>
<p>dious to you. Know that, one by one, my friends</p>
<p>were snatched away; I was left desolate. My own</p>
<p>strength is exhausted; and I must tell, in a few</p>
<p>words, what remains of my hideous narration.</p>
<p>I arrived at Geneva. My father and Ernest yet</p>
<p>lived; but the former sunk under the tidings that I</p>
<p>bore. I see him now, excellent and venerable old</p>
<p>man! his eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had</p>
<p>lost their charm and their delight — his niece, his</p>
<p>more than daughter, whom he doated on with all</p>
<p>that affection which a man feels, who, in the decline</p>
<p>of life, having few affections, clings more earnestly</p>
<p>to those that remain. Cursed, cursed be the ﬁend</p>
<p>that brought misery on his grey hairs, and doomed</p>
<p>him to waste in wretchedness! He could not live</p>
<p>under the horrors that were accumulated around</p>
<p>him; an apoplectic ﬁt was brought on, and in a few</p>
<p>days he died in my arms.</p>
<p>What then became of me? I know not; I lost</p>
<p>sensation, and chains and darkness were the only</p>
<p>objects that pressed upon me. Sometimes, indeed,</p>
<p>I dreamt that I wandered in ﬂowery meadows and</p>
<p>pleasant vales with the friends of my youth; but</p>
<p>awoke, and found myself in a dungeon. Melancholy</p>
<p>followed, but by degrees I gained a clear conception</p>
<p>of my miseries and situation, and was then released</p>
<p>from my prison. For they had called me mad; and</p>
<p>during many months, as I understood, a solitary cell</p>
<p>had been my habitation.</p>
<p>But liberty had been a useless gift to me had</p>
<p>I not, as I awakened to reason, at the same time</p>
<p>awakened to revenge. As the memory of past mis-</p>
<p>fortunes pressed upon me, I began to reﬂect on</p>
<p>their cause — the monster whom I had created,</p>
<p>the miserable dæmon whom I had sent abroad into</p>
<p>the world for my destruction. I was possessed by a</p>
<p>maddening rage when I thought of him, and desired</p>
<p>and ardently prayed that I might have him within my</p>
<p>grasp to wreak a great and signal revenge on his</p>
<p>cursed head.</p>
<p>Nor did my hate long conﬁne itself to useless</p>
<p>wishes; I began to reﬂect on the best means of</p>
<p>securing him; and for this purpose, about a month</p>
<p>after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in</p>
<p>the town, and told him that I had an accusation to</p>
<p>make; that I knew the destroyer of my family; and</p>
<p>that I required him to exert his whole authority for</p>
<p>the apprehension of the murderer.</p>
<p>The magistrate listened to me with attention and</p>
<p>kindness: “Be assured, sir,” said he, “no pains or</p>
<p>exertions on my part shall be spared to discover</p>
<p>the villain.”</p>
<p>“I thank you,” replied I; “listen, therefore, to the</p>
<p>deposition that I have to make. It is indeed a tale</p>
<p>so strange, that I should fear you would not credit</p>
<p>it, were there not something in truth which, how-</p>
<p>ever wonderful, forces conviction. The story is too</p>
<p>connected to be mistaken for a dream, and I have</p>
<p>no motive for falsehood.” My manner, as I thus</p>
<p>addressed him, was impressive, but calm; I had</p>
<p>formed in my own heart a resolution to pursue my</p>
<p>destroyer to death; and this purpose quieted my</p>
<p>agony, and provisionally reconciled me to life. I now</p>
<p>related my history brieﬂy, but with ﬁrmness and pre-</p>
<p>cision, marking the dates with accuracy, and never</p>
<p>deviating into invective or exclamation.</p>
<p>The magistrate appeared at ﬁrst perfectly in-</p>
<p>credulous, but as I continued he became more at-</p>
<p>tentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shud-</p>
<p>der with horror, at others a lively surprise, unmin-</p>
<p>gled with disbelief, was painted on his countenance.</p>
<p>When I had concluded my narration, I said.</p>
<p>“This is the being whom I accuse, and for whose</p>
<p>detection and punishment I call upon you to exert</p>
<p>your whole power. It is your duty as a magistrate,</p>
<p>and I believe and hope that your feelings as a man</p>
<p>will not revolt from the execution of those functions</p>
<p>on this occasion.”</p>
<p>This address caused a considerable change in</p>
<p>the physiognomy of my auditor. He had heard my</p>
<p>story with that half kind of belief that is given to a</p>
<p>tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he</p>
<p>was called upon to act ofﬁcially in consequence, the</p>
<p>whole tide of his incredulity returned. He, however,</p>
<p>answered mildly, “I would willingly afford you every</p>
<p>aid in your pursuit; but the creature of whom you</p>
<p>speak appears to have powers which would put all</p>
<p>my exertions to deﬁance. Who can follow an animal</p>
<p>which can traverse the sea of ice, and inhabit caves</p>
<p>and dens, where no man would venture to intrude?</p>
<p>Besides, some months have elapsed since the com-</p>
<p>mission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture</p>
<p>to what place he has wandered, or what region he</p>
<p>may now inhabit.”</p>
<p>“I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot</p>
<p>which I inhabit; and if he has indeed taken refuge in</p>
<p>the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois, and</p>
<p>destroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive your</p>
<p>thoughts: you do not credit my narrative, and do not</p>
<p>intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment</p>
<p>which is his desert.”</p>
<p>As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the mag-</p>
<p>istrate was intimidated; “You are mistaken,” said</p>
<p>he, “I will exert myself; and if it is in my power to</p>
<p>seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer</p>
<p>punishment proportionate to his crimes. But I fear,</p>
<p>from what you have yourself described to be his</p>
<p>properties, that this will prove impracticable, and</p>
<p>that, while every proper measure is pursued, you</p>
<p>should endeavour to make up your mind to disap-</p>
<p>pointment.”</p>
<p>“That cannot be; but all that I can say will be</p>
<p>of little avail. My revenge is of no moment to you;</p>
<p>yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I confess that it</p>
<p>is the devouring and only passion of my soul. My</p>
<p>rage is unspeakable, when I reﬂect that the mur-</p>
<p>derer, whom I have turned loose upon society, still</p>
<p>exists. You refuse my just demand: I have but one</p>
<p>resource; and I devote myself, either in my life or</p>
<p>death, to his destruction.”</p>
<p>I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this;</p>
<p>there was a phrenzy in my manner, and something,</p>
<p>I doubt not, of that haughty ﬁerceness, which the</p>
<p>martyrs of old are said to have possessed. But to a</p>
<p>Genevan magistrate, whose mind was occupied by</p>
<p>far other ideas than those of devotion and heroism,</p>
<p>this elevation of mind had much the appearance</p>
<p>of madness. He endeavoured to soothe me as a</p>
<p>nurse does a child, and reverted to my tale as the</p>
<p>effects of delirium.</p>
<p>“Man,” I cried, “how ignorant art thou in thy pride</p>
<p>of wisdom! Cease; you know not what it is you say.”</p>
<p>I broke from the house angry and disturbed, and</p>
<p>retired to meditate on some other mode of action.</p>
<p>Chapter VII</p>
<p>MY present situation was one in which all volun-</p>
<p>tary thought was swallowed up and lost. I was</p>
<p>hurried away by fury; revenge alone endowed me</p>
<p>with strength and composure; it modelled my feel-</p>
<p>ings, and allowed me to be calculating and calm,</p>
<p>at periods when otherwise delirium or death would</p>
<p>have been my portion.</p>
<p>My ﬁrst resolution was to quit Geneva for ever;</p>
<p>my country, which, when I was happy and beloved,</p>
<p>was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became hate-</p>
<p>ful. I provided myself with a sum of money, together</p>
<p>371</p>
<p>with a few jewels which had belonged to my mother,</p>
<p>and departed.</p>
<p>And now my wanderings began, which are to</p>
<p>cease but with life. I have traversed a vast portion of</p>
<p>the earth, and have endured all the hardships which</p>
<p>travellers, in deserts and barbarous countries, are</p>
<p>wont to meet. How I have lived I hardly know; many</p>
<p>times have I stretched my failing limbs upon the</p>
<p>sandy plain, and prayed for death. But revenge kept</p>
<p>me alive; I dared not die, and leave my adversary</p>
<p>in being.</p>
<p>When I quitted Geneva, my ﬁrst labour was to</p>
<p>gain some clue by which I might trace the steps of</p>
<p>my ﬁendish enemy. But my plan was unsettled; and</p>
<p>I wandered many hours around the conﬁnes of the</p>
<p>town, uncertain what path I should pursue. As night</p>
<p>approached, I found myself at the entrance of the</p>
<p>cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father,</p>
<p>reposed. I entered it, and approached the tomb</p>
<p>which marked their graves. Every thing was silent,</p>
<p>except the leaves of the trees, which were gently</p>
<p>agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark; and</p>
<p>the scene would have been solemn and affecting</p>
<p>even to an uninterested observer. The spirits of</p>
<p>the departed seemed to ﬂit around, and to cast a</p>
<p>shadow, which was felt but seen not, around the</p>
<p>head of the mourner.</p>
<p>The deep grief which this scene had at ﬁrst ex-</p>
<p>cited quickly gave way to rage and despair. They</p>
<p>were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived,</p>
<p>and to destroy him I must drag out my weary exis-</p>
<p>tence. I knelt on the grass, and kissed the earth,</p>
<p>and with quivering lips exclaimed, “By the sacred</p>
<p>earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander</p>
<p>near me, by the deep and eternal grief that I feel, I</p>
<p>swear; and by thee, O Night, and by the spirits that</p>
<p>preside over thee, I swear to pursue the dæmon,</p>
<p>who caused this misery, until he or I shall perish</p>
<p>in mortal conﬂict. For this purpose I will preserve</p>
<p>my life: to execute this dear revenge, will I again</p>
<p>behold the sun, and tread the green herbage of</p>
<p>earth, which otherwise should vanish from my eyes</p>
<p>for ever. And I call on you, spirits of the dead; and</p>
<p>on you, wandering ministers of vengeance, to aid</p>
<p>and conduct me in my work. Let the cursed and</p>
<p>hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the</p>
<p>despair that now torments me.”</p>
<p>I had begun my adjuration with solemnity, and</p>
<p>an awe which almost assured me that the shades</p>
<p>of my murdered friends heard and approved my de-</p>
<p>votion; but the furies possessed me as I concluded,</p>
<p>and rage choaked my utterance.</p>
<p>I was answered through the stillness of night</p>
<p>by a loud and ﬁendish laugh. It rung on my ears</p>
<p>long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed it, and I</p>
<p>felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and</p>
<p>laughter. Surely in that moment I should have been</p>
<p>possessed by phrenzy, and have destroyed my mis-</p>
<p>erable existence, but that my vow was heard, and</p>
<p>that I was reserved for vengeance. The laughter</p>
<p>died away: when a well-known and abhorred voice,</p>
<p>apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an au-</p>
<p>dible whisper — “I am satisﬁed: miserable wretch!</p>
<p>you have determined to live, and I am satisﬁed.”</p>
<p>I darted towards the spot from which the sound</p>
<p>proceeded; but the devil eluded my grasp. Sud-</p>
<p>denly the broad disk of the moon arose, and shone</p>
<p>full upon his ghastly and distorted shape, as he ﬂed</p>
<p>with more than mortal speed.</p>
<p>I pursued him; and for many months this has</p>
<p>been my task. Guided by a slight clue, I followed</p>
<p>the windings of the Rhone, but vainly. The blue</p>
<p>Mediterranean appeared; and, by a strange chance,</p>
<p>I saw the ﬁend enter by night, and hide himself in a</p>
<p>vessel bound for the Black Sea. I took my passage</p>
<p>in the same ship; but he escaped, I know not how.</p>
<p>Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, al-</p>
<p>though he still evaded me, I have ever followed</p>
<p>in his track. Sometimes the peasants, scared by</p>
<p>this horrid apparition, informed me of his path;</p>
<p>sometimes he himself, who feared that if I lost all</p>
<p>trace I should despair and die, often left some mark</p>
<p>to guide me. The snows descended on my head,</p>
<p>and I saw the print of his huge step on the white</p>
<p>plain. To you ﬁrst entering on life, to whom care is</p>
<p>new, and agony unknown, how can you understand</p>
<p>what I have felt, and still feel? Cold, want, and</p>
<p>fatigue, were the least pains which I was destined</p>
<p>to endure; I was cursed by some devil, and carried</p>
<p>about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of</p>
<p>good followed and directed my steps, and, when I</p>
<p>most murmured, would suddenly extricate me from</p>
<p>seemingly insurmountable difﬁculties. Sometimes,</p>
<p>when nature, overcome by hunger, sunk under the</p>
<p>exhaustion, a repast was prepared for me in the</p>
<p>desert, that restored and inspirited me. The fare</p>
<p>was indeed coarse, such as the peasants of the</p>
<p>country ate; but I may not doubt that it was set</p>
<p>there by the spirits that I had invoked to aid me.</p>
<p>Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless,</p>
<p>and I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would</p>
<p>bedim the sky, shed the few drops that revived me,</p>
<p>and vanish.</p>
<p>I followed, when I could, the courses of the</p>
<p>rivers; but the dæmon generally avoided these, as</p>
<p>it was here that the population of the country chieﬂy</p>
<p>collected. In other places human beings were sel-</p>
<p>dom seen; and I generally subsisted on the wild</p>
<p>animals that crossed my path. I had money with</p>
<p>me, and gained the friendship of the villagers by</p>
<p>distributing it, or bringing with me some food that I</p>
<p>had killed, which, after taking a small part, I always</p>
<p>presented to those who had provided me with ﬁre</p>
<p>and utensils for cooking.</p>
<p>My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to</p>
<p>me, and it was during sleep alone that I could taste</p>
<p>joy. O blessed sleep! often, when most miserable, I</p>
<p>sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to</p>
<p>rapture. The spirits that guarded me had provided</p>
<p>these moments, or rather hours, of happiness, that</p>
<p>I might retain strength to fulﬁl my pilgrimage. De-</p>
<p>prived of this respite, I should have sunk under my</p>
<p>hardships. During the day I was sustained and in-</p>
<p>spirited by the hope of night: for in sleep I saw my</p>
<p>friends, my wife, and my beloved country; again</p>
<p>I saw the benevolent countenance of my father,</p>
<p>heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth’s voice, and</p>
<p>beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth. Often,</p>
<p>when wearied by a toilsome march, I persuaded</p>
<p>myself that I was dreaming until night should come,</p>
<p>and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of</p>
<p>my dearest friends. What agonizing fondness did</p>
<p>I feel for them! how did I cling to their dear forms,</p>
<p>as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours,</p>
<p>and persuade myself that they still lived! At such</p>
<p>moments vengeance, that burned within me, died</p>
<p>in my heart, and I pursued my path towards the de-</p>
<p>struction of the dæmon, more as a task enjoined by</p>
<p>heaven, as the mechanical impulse of some power</p>
<p>of which I was unconscious, than as the ardent</p>
<p>desire of my soul.</p>
<p>What his feelings were whom I pursued, I can-</p>
<p>not know. Sometimes, indeed, he left marks in</p>
<p>writing on the barks of the trees, or cut in stone,</p>
<p>that guided me, and instigated my fury. “My reign</p>
<p>is not yet over,” (these words were legible in one</p>
<p>of these inscriptions); “you live, and my power is</p>
<p>complete. Follow me; I seek the everlasting ices of</p>
<p>the north, where you will feel the misery of cold and</p>
<p>frost, to which I am impassive. You will ﬁnd near</p>
<p>this place, if you follow not too tardily, a dead hare;</p>
<p>eat, and be refreshed. Come on, my enemy; we</p>
<p>have yet to wrestle for our lives; but many hard and</p>
<p>miserable hours must you endure, until that period</p>
<p>shall arrive.”</p>
<p>Scofﬁng devil! Again do I vow vengeance; again</p>
<p>do I devote thee, miserable ﬁend, to torture and</p>
<p>death. Never will I omit my search, until he or I</p>
<p>perish; and then with what ecstacy shall I join my</p>
<p>Elizabeth, and those who even now prepare for me</p>
<p>the reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrim-</p>
<p>age.</p>
<p>As I still pursued my journey to the northward,</p>
<p>the snows thickened, and the cold increased in a</p>
<p>degree almost too severe to support. The peasants</p>
<p>were shut up in their hovels, and only a few of</p>
<p>the most hardy ventured forth to seize the animals</p>
<p>whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places</p>
<p>to seek for prey. The rivers were covered with ice,</p>
<p>and no ﬁsh could be procured; and thus I was cut</p>
<p>off from my chief article of maintenance.</p>
<p>The triumph of my enemy increased with the</p>
<p>difﬁculty of my labours. One inscription that he left</p>
<p>was in these words: “Prepare! your toils only begin:</p>
<p>wrap yourself in furs, and provide food, for we shall</p>
<p>soon enter upon a journey where your sufferings</p>
<p>will satisfy my everlasting hatred.”</p>
<p>My courage and perseverance were invigorated</p>
<p>by these scofﬁng words; I resolved not to fail in</p>
<p>my purpose; and, calling on heaven to support</p>
<p>me, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse</p>
<p>immense deserts, until the ocean appeared at a</p>
<p>distance, and formed the utmost boundary of the</p>
<p>horizon. Oh! how unlike it was to the blue seas</p>
<p>of the south! Covered with ice, it was only to be</p>
<p>distinguished from land by its superior wildness and</p>
<p>ruggedness. The Greeks wept for joy when they</p>
<p>beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia,</p>
<p>and hailed with rapture the boundary of their toils.</p>
<p>I did not weep; but I knelt down, and, with a full</p>
<p>heart, thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me</p>
<p>in safety to the place where I hoped, notwithstand-</p>
<p>ing my adversary’s gibe, to meet and grapple with</p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>Some weeks before this period I had procured</p>
<p>a sledge and dogs, and thus traversed the snows</p>
<p>with inconceivable speed. I know not whether the</p>
<p>ﬁend possessed the same advantages; but I found</p>
<p>that, as before I had daily lost ground in the pursuit,</p>
<p>I now gained on him; so much so, that when I ﬁrst</p>
<p>saw the ocean, he was but one day’s journey in</p>
<p>advance, and I hoped to intercept him before he</p>
<p>should reach the beach. With new courage, there-</p>
<p>fore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a</p>
<p>wretched hamlet on the seashore. I inquired of the</p>
<p>inhabitants concerning the ﬁend, and gained ac-</p>
<p>curate information. A gigantic monster, they said,</p>
<p>had arrived the night before, armed with a gun and</p>
<p>many pistols; putting to ﬂight the inhabitants of a</p>
<p>solitary cottage, through fear of his terriﬁc appear-</p>
<p>ance. He had carried off their store of winter food,</p>
<p>and, placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had</p>
<p>seized on a numerous drove of trained dogs, he</p>
<p>had harnessed them, and the same night, to the</p>
<p>joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his</p>
<p>journey across the sea in a direction that led to no</p>
<p>land; and they conjectured that he must speedily</p>
<p>be destroyed by the breaking of the ice, or frozen</p>
<p>by the eternal frosts.</p>
<p>On hearing this information, I suffered a tempo-</p>
<p>rary access of despair. He had escaped me; and</p>
<p>I must commence a destructive and almost end-</p>
<p>less journey across the mountainous ices of the</p>
<p>ocean, — amidst cold that few of the inhabitants</p>
<p>could long endure, and which I, the native of a ge-</p>
<p>nial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive.</p>
<p>Yet at the idea that the ﬁend should live and be</p>
<p>triumphant, my rage and vengeance returned, and,</p>
<p>like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling.</p>
<p>After a slight repose, during which the spirits of the</p>
<p>dead hovered round, and instigated me to toil and</p>
<p>revenge, I prepared for my journey.</p>
<p>I exchanged my land sledge for one fashioned</p>
<p>for the inequalities of the frozen ocean; and, pur-</p>
<p>chasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I departed</p>
<p>from land.</p>
<p>I cannot guess how many days have passed</p>
<p>since then; but I have endured misery, which noth-</p>
<p>ing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution</p>
<p>burning within my heart could have enabled me to</p>
<p>support. Immense and rugged mountains of ice</p>
<p>often barred up my passage, and I often heard the</p>
<p>thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my</p>
<p>destruction. But again the frost came, and made</p>
<p>the paths of the sea secure.</p>
<p>By the quantity of provision which I had con-</p>
<p>sumed I should guess that I had passed three</p>
<p>weeks in this journey; and the continual protrac-</p>
<p>tion of hope, returning back upon the heart, often</p>
<p>wrung bitter drops of despondency and grief from</p>
<p>my eyes. Despair had indeed almost secured her</p>
<p>prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this</p>
<p>misery; when once, after the poor animals that car-</p>
<p>ried me had with incredible toil gained the summit</p>
<p>of a sloping ice mountain, and one sinking under</p>
<p>his fatigue died, I viewed the expanse before me</p>
<p>with anguish, when suddenly my eye caught a dark</p>
<p>speck upon the dusky plain. I strained my sight to</p>
<p>discover what it could be, and uttered a wild cry</p>
<p>of ecstacy when I distinguished a sledge, and the</p>
<p>distorted proportions of a well-known form within.</p>
<p>Oh! with what a burning gush did hope revisit my</p>
<p>heart! warm tears ﬁlled my eyes, which I hastily</p>
<p>wiped away, that they might not intercept the view I</p>
<p>had of the dæmon; but still my sight was dimmed by</p>
<p>the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions</p>
<p>that oppressed me, I wept aloud.</p>
<p>But this was not the time for delay; I disencum-</p>
<p>bered the dogs of their dead companion, gave them</p>
<p>a plentiful portion of food; and, after an hour’s rest,</p>
<p>which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was</p>
<p>bitterly irksome to me, I continued my route. The</p>
<p>sledge was still visible; nor did I again lose sight of it,</p>
<p>except at the moments when for a short time some</p>
<p>ice rock concealed it with its intervening crags. I</p>
<p>indeed perceptibly gained on it; and when, after</p>
<p>nearly two days’ journey, I beheld my enemy at no</p>
<p>more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within</p>
<p>me.</p>
<p>But now, when I appeared almost within grasp</p>
<p>of my enemy, my hopes were suddenly extin-</p>
<p>guished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than</p>
<p>I had ever done before. A ground sea was heard;</p>
<p>the thunder of its progress, as the waters rolled and</p>
<p>swelled beneath me, became every moment more</p>
<p>ominous and terriﬁc. I pressed on, but in vain. The</p>
<p>wind arose; the sea roared; and, as with the mighty</p>
<p>shock of an earthquake, it split, and cracked with</p>
<p>a tremendous and overwhelming sound. The work</p>
<p>was soon ﬁnished: in a few minutes a tumultuous</p>
<p>sea rolled between me and my enemy, and I was</p>
<p>left drifting on a scattered piece of ice, that was</p>
<p>continually lessening, and thus preparing for me a</p>
<p>hideous death.</p>
<p>In this manner many appalling hours passed;</p>
<p>several of my dogs died; and I myself was about</p>
<p>to sink under the accumulation of distress, when</p>
<p>I saw your vessel riding at anchor, and holding</p>
<p>forth to me hopes of succour and life. I had no</p>
<p>conception that vessels ever came so far north, and</p>
<p>was astounded at the sight. I quickly destroyed part</p>
<p>of my sledge to construct oars; and by these means</p>
<p>was enabled, with inﬁnite fatigue, to move my ice-</p>
<p>raft in the direction of your ship. I had determined, if</p>
<p>you were going southward, still to trust myself to the</p>
<p>mercy of the seas, rather than abandon my purpose.</p>
<p>I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which</p>
<p>I could still pursue my enemy. But your direction</p>
<p>was northward. You took me on board when my</p>
<p>vigour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk</p>
<p>under my multiplied hardships into a death, which I</p>
<p>still dread, — for my task is unfulﬁlled.</p>
<p>Oh! when will my guiding spirit, in conducting</p>
<p>me to the dæmon, allow me the rest I so much</p>
<p>desire; or must I die, and he yet live? If I do, swear</p>
<p>to me, Walton, that he shall not escape; that you will</p>
<p>seek him, and satisfy my vengeance in his death.</p>
<p>Yet, do I dare ask you to undertake my pilgrimage,</p>
<p>to endure the hardships that I have undergone?</p>
<p>No; I am not so selﬁsh. Yet, when I am dead, if</p>
<p>he should appear; if the ministers of vengeance</p>
<p>should conduct him to you, swear that he shall not</p>
<p>live — swear that he shall not triumph over my</p>
<p>accumulated woes, and live to make another such</p>
<p>a wretch as I am. He is eloquent and persuasive;</p>
<p>and once his words had even power over my heart:</p>
<p>but trust him not. His soul is as hellish as his form,</p>
<p>full of treachery and ﬁend-like malice. Hear him</p>
<p>not; call on the manes of William, Justine, Clerval,</p>
<p>Elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched Victor,</p>
<p>and thrust your sword into his heart. I will hover</p>
<p>near, and direct the steel aright.</p>
<p>WALTON, in continuation.</p>
<p>August 26th, 17— .</p>
<p>YOU have read this strange and terriﬁc story, Mar-</p>
<p>garet; and do you not feel your blood congealed</p>
<p>with horror, like that which even now curdles mine?</p>
<p>Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could</p>
<p>not continue his tale; at others, his voice broken,</p>
<p>yet piercing, uttered with difﬁculty the words so re-</p>
<p>plete with agony. His ﬁne and lovely eyes were now</p>
<p>lighted up with indignation, now subdued to down-</p>
<p>cast sorrow, and quenched in inﬁnite wretchedness.</p>
<p>Sometimes he commanded his countenance and</p>
<p>tones, and related the most horrible incidents with a</p>
<p>tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation;</p>
<p>then, like a volcano bursting forth, his face would</p>
<p>suddenly change to an expression of the wildest</p>
<p>rage, as he shrieked out imprecations on his perse-</p>
<p>cutor.</p>
<p>His tale is connected, and told with an appear-</p>
<p>ance of the simplest truth; yet I own to you that the</p>
<p>letters of Felix and Saﬁe, which he shewed me, and</p>
<p>the apparition of the monster, seen from our ship,</p>
<p>brought to me a greater conviction of the truth of his</p>
<p>narrative than his asseverations, however earnest</p>
<p>and connected. Such a monster has then really</p>
<p>existence; I cannot doubt it; yet I am lost in surprise</p>
<p>and admiration. Sometimes I endeavoured to gain</p>
<p>from Frankenstein the particulars of his creature’s</p>
<p>formation; but on this point he was impenetrable.</p>
<p>“Are you mad, my friend?” said he, “or whither</p>
<p>does your senseless curiosity lead you? Would you</p>
<p>also create for yourself and the world a demonia-</p>
<p>cal enemy? Or to what do your questions tend?</p>
<p>Peace, peace! learn my miseries, and do not seek</p>
<p>to increase your own.”</p>
<p>Frankenstein discovered that I made notes con-</p>
<p>cerning his history: he asked to see them, and then</p>
<p>himself corrected and augmented them in many</p>
<p>places; but principally in giving the life and spirit to</p>
<p>the conversations he held with his enemy. “Since</p>
<p>you have preserved my narration,” said he, “I would</p>
<p>not that a mutilated one should go down to poster-</p>
<p>ity.”</p>
<p>Thus has a week passed away, while I have</p>
<p>listened to the strangest tale that ever imagination</p>
<p>formed. My thoughts, and every feeling of my soul,</p>
<p>have been drunk up by the interest for my guest,</p>
<p>which this tale, and his own elevated and gentle</p>
<p>manners have created. I wish to soothe him; yet</p>
<p>can I counsel one so inﬁnitely miserable, so desti-</p>
<p>tute of every hope of consolation, to live? Oh, no!</p>
<p>the only joy that he can now know will be when</p>
<p>he composes his shattered feelings to peace and</p>
<p>death. Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring</p>
<p>of solitude and delirium: he believes, that, when</p>
<p>in dreams he holds converse with his friends, and</p>
<p>derives from that communion consolation for his</p>
<p>miseries, or excitements to his vengeance, that</p>
<p>they are not the creations of his fancy, but the real</p>
<p>beings who visit him from the regions of a remote</p>
<p>world. This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries</p>
<p>that render them to me almost as imposing and</p>
<p>interesting as truth.</p>
<p>Our conversations are not always conﬁned to</p>
<p>his own history and misfortunes. On every point</p>
<p>of general literature he displays unbounded knowl-</p>
<p>edge, and a quick and piercing apprehension. His</p>
<p>eloquence is forcible and touching; nor can I hear</p>
<p>him, when he relates a pathetic incident, or endeav-</p>
<p>ours to move the passions of pity or love, without</p>
<p>tears. What a glorious creature must he have been</p>
<p>in the days of his prosperity, when he is thus noble</p>
<p>and godlike in ruin. He seems to feel his own worth,</p>
<p>and the greatness of his fall.</p>
<p>“When younger,” said he, “I felt as if I were des-</p>
<p>tined for some great enterprise. My feelings are pro-</p>
<p>found; but I possessed a coolness of judgment that</p>
<p>ﬁtted me for illustrious achievements. This senti-</p>
<p>ment of the worth of my nature supported me, when</p>
<p>others would have been oppressed; for I deemed it</p>
<p>criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents</p>
<p>that might be useful to my fellow-creatures. When I</p>
<p>reﬂected on the work I had completed, no less a one</p>
<p>than the creation of a sensitive and rational animal,</p>
<p>I could not rank myself with the herd of common</p>
<p>projectors. But this feeling, which supported me in</p>
<p>the commencement of my career, now serves only</p>
<p>to plunge me lower in the dust. All my speculations</p>
<p>and hopes are as nothing; and, like the archangel</p>
<p>who aspired to omnipotence, I am chained in an</p>
<p>eternal hell. My imagination was vivid, yet my pow-</p>
<p>ers of analysis and application were intense; by the</p>
<p>union of these qualities I conceived the idea, and</p>
<p>executed the creation of a man. Even now I cannot</p>
<p>recollect, without passion, my reveries while the</p>
<p>work was incomplete. I trod heaven in my thoughts,</p>
<p>now exulting in my powers, now burning with the</p>
<p>idea of their effects. From my infancy I was imbued</p>
<p>with high hopes and a lofty ambition; but how am I</p>
<p>sunk! Oh! my friend, if you had known me as I once</p>
<p>was, you would not recognize me in this state of</p>
<p>degradation. Despondency rarely visited my heart;</p>
<p>a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell,</p>
<p>never, never again to rise.”</p>
<p>Must I then lose this admirable being? I have</p>
<p>longed for a friend; I have sought one who would</p>
<p>sympathize with and love me. Behold, on these</p>
<p>desert seas I have found such a one; but, I fear, I</p>
<p>have gained him only to know his value, and lose</p>
<p>him. I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses</p>
<p>the idea.</p>
<p>“I thank you, Walton,” he said, “for your kind</p>
<p>intentions towards so miserable a wretch; but when</p>
<p>you speak of new ties, and fresh affections, think</p>
<p>you that any can replace those who are gone? Can</p>
<p>any man be to me as Clerval was; or any woman</p>
<p>another Elizabeth? Even where the affections are</p>
<p>not strongly moved by any superior excellence, the</p>
<p>companions of our childhood always possess a cer-</p>
<p>tain power over our minds, which hardly any later</p>
<p>friend can obtain. They know our infantine dispo-</p>
<p>sitions, which, however they may be afterwards</p>
<p>modiﬁed, are never eradicated; and they can judge</p>
<p>of our actions with more certain conclusions as to</p>
<p>the integrity of our motives. A sister or a brother can</p>
<p>never, unless indeed such symptoms have been</p>
<p>shewn early, suspect the other of fraud or false deal-</p>
<p>ing, when another friend, however strongly he may</p>
<p>be attached, may, in spite of himself, be invaded</p>
<p>with suspicion. But I enjoyed friends, dear not only</p>
<p>through habit and association, but from their own</p>
<p>merits; and, wherever I am, the soothing voice of</p>
<p>my Elizabeth, and the conversation of Clerval, will</p>
<p>be ever whispered in my ear. They are dead; and</p>
<p>but one feeling in such a solitude can persuade me</p>
<p>to preserve my life. If I were engaged in any high</p>
<p>undertaking or design, fraught with extensive util-</p>
<p>ity to my fellow-creatures, then could I live to fulﬁl</p>
<p>it. But such is not my destiny; I must pursue and</p>
<p>destroy the being to whom I gave existence; then</p>
<p>my lot on earth will be fulﬁlled, and I may die.”</p>
<p>September 2d.</p>
<p>MY BELOVED SISTER,</p>
<p>I write to you, encompassed by peril, and igno-</p>
<p>rant whether I am ever doomed to see again dear</p>
<p>England, and the dearer friends that inhabit it. I am</p>
<p>surrounded by mountains of ice, which admit of no</p>
<p>escape, and threaten every moment to crush my</p>
<p>vessel. The brave fellows, whom I have persuaded</p>
<p>to be my companions, look towards me for aid; but</p>
<p>I have none to bestow. There is something terri-</p>
<p>bly appalling in our situation, yet my courage and</p>
<p>hopes do not desert me. We may survive; and if</p>
<p>we do not, I will repeat the lessons of my Seneca,</p>
<p>and die with a good heart.</p>
<p>Yet what, Margaret, will be the state of your</p>
<p>mind? You will not hear of my destruction, and</p>
<p>you will anxiously await my return. Years will pass,</p>
<p>and you will have visitings of despair, and yet be</p>
<p>tortured by hope. Oh! my beloved sister, the sick-</p>
<p>ening failings of your heart-felt expectations are, in</p>
<p>prospect, more terrible to me than my own death.</p>
<p>But you have a husband, and lovely children; you</p>
<p>may be happy: heaven bless you, and make you</p>
<p>so!</p>
<p>My unfortunate guest regards me with the ten-</p>
<p>derest compassion. He endeavours to ﬁll me with</p>
<p>hope; and talks as if life were a possession which</p>
<p>he valued. He reminds me how often the same</p>
<p>accidents have happened to other navigators, who</p>
<p>have attempted this sea, and, in spite of myself, he</p>
<p>ﬁlls me with cheerful auguries. Even the sailors feel</p>
<p>the power of his eloquence: when he speaks, they</p>
<p>no longer despair; he rouses their energies, and,</p>
<p>while they hear his voice, they believe these vast</p>
<p>mountains of ice are mole-hills, which will vanish</p>
<p>before the resolutions of man. These feelings are</p>
<p>transitory; each day’s expectation delayed ﬁlls them</p>
<p>with fear, and I almost dread a mutiny caused by</p>
<p>this despair.</p>
<p>September 5th.</p>
<p>A scene has just passed of such uncommon in-</p>
<p>terest, that although it is highly probable that these</p>
<p>papers may never reach you, yet I cannot forbear</p>
<p>recording it.</p>
<p>We are still surrounded by mountains of ice,</p>
<p>still in imminent danger of being crushed in their</p>
<p>conﬂict. The cold is excessive, and many of my</p>
<p>unfortunate comrades have already found a grave</p>
<p>amidst this scene of desolation. Frankenstein has</p>
<p>daily declined in health: a feverish ﬁre still glim-</p>
<p>mers in his eyes; but he is exhausted, and, when</p>
<p>suddenly roused to any exertion, he speedily sinks</p>
<p>again into apparent lifelessness.</p>
<p>I mentioned in my last letter the fears I enter-</p>
<p>tained of a mutiny. This morning, as I sat watching</p>
<p>the wan countenance of my friend — his eyes half</p>
<p>closed, and his limbs hanging listlessly, — I was</p>
<p>roused by half a dozen of the sailors, who desired</p>
<p>admission into the cabin. They entered; and their</p>
<p>leader addressed me. He told me that he and his</p>
<p>companions had been chosen by the other sailors</p>
<p>to come in deputation to me, to make me a demand,</p>
<p>which, in justice, I could not refuse. We were im-</p>
<p>mured in ice, and should probably never escape;</p>
<p>but they feared that if, as was possible, the ice</p>
<p>should dissipate, and a free passage be opened, I</p>
<p>should be rash enough to continue my voyage, and</p>
<p>lead them into fresh dangers, after they might hap-</p>
<p>pily have surmounted this. They desired, therefore,</p>
<p>that I should engage with a solemn promise, that if</p>
<p>the vessel should be freed, I would instantly direct</p>
<p>my coarse southward.</p>
<p>This speech troubled me. I had not despaired;</p>
<p>nor had I yet conceived the idea of returning, if</p>
<p>set free. Yet could I, in justice, or even in possi-</p>
<p>bility, refuse this demand? I hesitated before I an-</p>
<p>swered; when Frankenstein, who had at ﬁrst been</p>
<p>silent, and, indeed, appeared hardly to have force</p>
<p>enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes</p>
<p>sparkled, and his cheeks ﬂushed with momentary</p>
<p>vigour. Turning towards the men, he said —</p>
<p>“What do you mean? What do you demand of</p>
<p>your captain? Are you then so easily turned from</p>
<p>your design? Did you not call this a glorious expedi-</p>
<p>tion? and wherefore was it glorious? Not because</p>
<p>the way was smooth and placid as a southern sea,</p>
<p>but because it was full of dangers and terror; be-</p>
<p>cause, at every new incident, your fortitude was</p>
<p>to be called forth, and your courage exhibited; be-</p>
<p>cause danger and death surrounded, and these</p>
<p>dangers you were to brave and overcome. For this</p>
<p>was it a glorious, for this was it an honourable un-</p>
<p>dertaking. You were hereafter to be hailed as the</p>
<p>benefactors of your species; your name adored, as</p>
<p>belonging to brave men who encountered death</p>
<p>for honour and the beneﬁt of mankind. And now,</p>
<p>behold, with the ﬁrst imagination of danger, or, if</p>
<p>you will, the ﬁrst mighty and terriﬁc trial of your</p>
<p>courage, you shrink away, and are content to be</p>
<p>handed down as men who had not strength enough</p>
<p>to endure cold and peril; and so, poor souls, they</p>
<p>were chilly, and returned to their warm ﬁre-sides.</p>
<p>Why, that requires not this preparation; ye need not</p>
<p>have come thus far, and dragged your captain to</p>
<p>the shame of a defeat, merely to prove yourselves</p>
<p>cowards. Oh! be men, or be more than men. Be</p>
<p>steady to your purposes, and ﬁrm as a rock. This</p>
<p>ice is not made of such stuff as your hearts might</p>
<p>be; it is mutable, cannot withstand you, if you say</p>
<p>that it shall not. Do not return to your families with</p>
<p>the stigma of disgrace marked on your brows. Re-</p>
<p>turn as heroes who have fought and conquered,</p>
<p>and who know not what it is to turn their backs on</p>
<p>the foe.”</p>
<p>He spoke this with a voice so modulated to the</p>
<p>different feelings expressed in his speech, with an</p>
<p>eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can you</p>
<p>wonder that these men were moved. They looked</p>
<p>at one another, and were unable to reply. I spoke; I</p>
<p>told them to retire, and consider of what had been</p>
<p>said: that I would not lead them further north, if they</p>
<p>strenuously desired the contrary; but that I hoped</p>
<p>that, with reﬂection, their courage would return.</p>
<p>They retired, and I turned towards my friend;</p>
<p>but he was sunk in languor, and almost deprived of</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>How all this will terminate, I know not; but I</p>
<p>had rather die, than return shamefully, — my pur-</p>
<p>pose unfulﬁlled. Yet I fear such will be my fate; the</p>
<p>men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour,</p>
<p>can never willingly continue to endure their present</p>
<p>hardships.</p>
<p>September 7th.</p>
<p>The die is cast; I have consented to return, if</p>
<p>we are not destroyed. Thus are my hopes blasted</p>
<p>by cowardice and indecision; I come back ignorant</p>
<p>and disappointed. It requires more philosophy than</p>
<p>I possess, to bear this injustice with patience.</p>
<p>September 12th.</p>
<p>It is past; I am returning to England. I have</p>
<p>lost my hopes of utility and glory; — I have lost my</p>
<p>friend. But I will endeavour to detail these bitter</p>
<p>circumstances to you, my dear sister; and, while I</p>
<p>am wafted towards England, and towards you, I will</p>
<p>not despond.</p>
<p>September 19th, the ice began to move, and</p>
<p>roarings like thunder were heard at a distance, as</p>
<p>the islands split and cracked in every direction. We</p>
<p>were in the most imminent peril; but, as we could</p>
<p>only remain passive, my chief attention was oc-</p>
<p>cupied by my unfortunate guest, whose illness in-</p>
<p>creased in such a degree, that he was entirely con-</p>
<p>ﬁned to his bed. The ice cracked behind us, and</p>
<p>was driven with force towards the north; a breeze</p>
<p>sprung from the west, and on the 11th the passage</p>
<p>towards the south became perfectly free. When</p>
<p>the sailors saw this, and that their return to their</p>
<p>native country was apparently assured, a shout</p>
<p>of tumultuous joy broke from them, loud and long-</p>
<p>continued. Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke,</p>
<p>and asked the cause of the tumult. “They shout,” I</p>
<p>said, “because they will soon return to England.”</p>
<p>“Do you then really return?”</p>
<p>“Alas! yes; I cannot withstand their demands. I</p>
<p>cannot lead them unwillingly to danger, and I must</p>
<p>return.”</p>
<p>“Do so, if you will; but I will not. You may give</p>
<p>up your purpose; but mine is assigned to me by</p>
<p>heaven, and I dare not. I am weak; but surely the</p>
<p>spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with</p>
<p>sufﬁcient strength.” Saying this, he endeavoured to</p>
<p>spring from the bed, but the exertion was too great</p>
<p>for him; he fell back, and fainted.</p>
<p>It was long before he was restored; and I often</p>
<p>thought that life was entirely extinct. At length he</p>
<p>opened his eyes, but he breathed with difﬁculty,</p>
<p>and was unable to speak. The surgeon gave him</p>
<p>a composing draught, and ordered us to leave him</p>
<p>undisturbed. In the mean time he told me, that my</p>
<p>friend had certainly not many hours to live.</p>
<p>His sentence was pronounced; and I could only</p>
<p>grieve, and be patient. I sat by his bed watching</p>
<p>him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept;</p>
<p>but presently he called to me in a feeble voice, and,</p>
<p>bidding me come near, said — “Alas! the strength</p>
<p>I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall soon die, and</p>
<p>he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in be-</p>
<p>ing. Think not, Walton, that in the last moments</p>
<p>of my existence I feel that burning hatred, and ar-</p>
<p>dent desire of revenge, I once expressed, but I feel</p>
<p>myself justiﬁed in desiring the death of my adver-</p>
<p>sary. During these last days I have been occupied</p>
<p>in examining my past conduct; nor do I ﬁnd it blame-</p>
<p>able. In a ﬁt of enthusiastic madness I created a</p>
<p>rational creature, and was bound towards him, to</p>
<p>assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness</p>
<p>and well-being. This was my duty; but there was</p>
<p>another still paramount to that. My duties towards</p>
<p>my fellow-creatures had greater claims to my atten-</p>
<p>tion, because they included a greater proportion of</p>
<p>happiness or misery. Urged by this view, I refused,</p>
<p>and I did right in refusing, to create a companion</p>
<p>for the ﬁrst creature. He shewed unparalleled ma-</p>
<p>lignity and selﬁshness, in evil: he destroyed my</p>
<p>friends; he devoted to destruction beings who pos-</p>
<p>sessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wis-</p>
<p>dom; nor do I know where this thirst for vengeance</p>
<p>may end. Miserable himself, that he may render</p>
<p>no other wretched, he ought to die. The task of</p>
<p>his destruction was mine, but I have failed. When</p>
<p>actuated by selﬁsh and vicious motives, I asked you</p>
<p>to undertake my unﬁnished work; and I renew this</p>
<p>request now, when I am only induced by reason</p>
<p>and virtue.</p>
<p>“Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country</p>
<p>and friends, to fulﬁl this task; and now, that you are</p>
<p>returning to England, you will have little chance of</p>
<p>meeting with him. But the consideration of these</p>
<p>points, and the well-balancing of what you may</p>
<p>esteem your duties, I leave to you; my judgment and</p>
<p>ideas are already disturbed by the near approach</p>
<p>of death. I dare not ask you to do what I think right,</p>
<p>for I may still be misled by passion.</p>
<p>“That he should live to be an instrument of mis-</p>
<p>chief disturbs me; in other respects this hour, when</p>
<p>I momentarily expect my release, is the only happy</p>
<p>one which I have enjoyed for several years. The</p>
<p>forms of the beloved dead ﬂit before me, and I has-</p>
<p>ten to their arms. Farewell, Walton! Seek happiness</p>
<p>in tranquillity, and avoid ambition, even if it be only</p>
<p>the apparently innocent one of distinguishing your-</p>
<p>self in science and discoveries. Yet why do I say</p>
<p>this? I have myself been blasted in these hopes,</p>
<p>yet another may succeed.”</p>
<p>His voice became fainter as he spoke; and at</p>
<p>length, exhausted by his effort, he sunk into silence.</p>
<p>About half an hour afterwards he attempted again to</p>
<p>speak, but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly,</p>
<p>and his eyes closed for ever, while the irradiation of</p>
<p>a gentle smile passed away from his lips.</p>
<p>Margaret, what comment can I make on the</p>
<p>untimely extinction of this glorious spirit? What can</p>
<p>I say, that will enable you to understand the depth</p>
<p>of my sorrow? All that I should express would be</p>
<p>inadequate and feeble. My tears ﬂow; my mind is</p>
<p>overshadowed by a cloud of disappointment. But</p>
<p>I journey towards England, and I may there ﬁnd</p>
<p>consolation.</p>
<p>I am interrupted. What do these sounds por-</p>
<p>tend? It is midnight; the breeze blows fairly, and the</p>
<p>watch on deck scarcely stir. Again; there is a sound</p>
<p>as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the</p>
<p>cabin where the remains of Frankenstein still lie. I</p>
<p>must arise, and examine. Good night, my sister.</p>
<p>Great God! what a scene has just taken place!</p>
<p>I am yet dizzy with the remembrance of it. I hardly</p>
<p>know whether I shall have the power to detail it; yet</p>
<p>the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete</p>
<p>without this ﬁnal and wonderful catastrophe.</p>
<p>I entered the cabin, where lay the remains of my</p>
<p>ill-fated and admirable friend. Over him hung a form</p>
<p>which I cannot ﬁnd words to describe; gigantic in</p>
<p>stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its proportions.</p>
<p>As he hung over the cofﬁn, his face was concealed</p>
<p>by long locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand</p>
<p>was extended, in colour and apparent texture like</p>
<p>that of a mummy. When he heard the sound of</p>
<p>my approach, he ceased to utter exclamations of</p>
<p>grief and horror, and sprung towards the window.</p>
<p>Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, of</p>
<p>such loathsome, yet appalling hideousness. I shut</p>
<p>my eyes involuntarily, and endeavoured to recollect</p>
<p>what were my duties with regard to this destroyer. I</p>
<p>called on him to stay.</p>
<p>He paused, looking on me with wonder; and,</p>
<p>again turning towards the lifeless form of his creator,</p>
<p>he seemed to forget my presence, and every fea-</p>
<p>ture and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest</p>
<p>rage of some uncontrollable passion.</p>
<p>“That is also my victim!” he exclaimed; “in his</p>
<p>murder my crimes are consummated; the miser-</p>
<p>able series of my being is wound to its close! Oh,</p>
<p>Frankenstein! generous and self-devoted being!</p>
<p>what does it avail that I now ask thee to pardon me?</p>
<p>I, who irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all</p>
<p>thou lovedst. Alas! he is cold; he may not answer</p>
<p>me.”</p>
<p>His voice seemed suffocated; and my ﬁrst im-</p>
<p>pulses, which had suggested to me the duty of</p>
<p>obeying the dying request of my friend, in destroy-</p>
<p>ing his enemy, were now suspended by a mixture</p>
<p>of curiosity and compassion. I approached this</p>
<p>tremendous being; I dared not again raise my looks</p>
<p>upon his face, there was something so scaring and</p>
<p>unearthly in his ugliness. I attempted to speak, but</p>
<p>the words died away on my lips. The monster con-</p>
<p>tinued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches.</p>
<p>At length I gathered resolution to address him, in</p>
<p>a pause of the tempest of his passion: “Your re-</p>
<p>pentance,” I said, “is now superﬂuous. If you had</p>
<p>listened to the voice of conscience, and heeded</p>
<p>the stings of remorse, before you had urged your</p>
<p>diabolical vengeance to this extremity, Frankenstein</p>
<p>would yet have lived.”</p>
<p>“And do you dream?” said the dæmon; “do you</p>
<p>think that I was then dead to agony and remorse?</p>
<p>— He,” he continued, pointing to the corpse, “he</p>
<p>suffered not more in the consummation of the deed;</p>
<p>— oh! not the ten-thousandth portion of the anguish</p>
<p>that was mine during the lingering detail of its exe-</p>
<p>cution. A frightful selﬁshness hurried me on, while</p>
<p>my heart was poisoned with remorse. Think ye that</p>
<p>the groans of Clerval were music to my ears? My</p>
<p>heart was fashioned to be susceptible of love and</p>
<p>sympathy; and, when wrenched by misery to vice</p>
<p>and hatred, it did not endure the violence of the</p>
<p>change without torture such as you cannot even</p>
<p>imagine.</p>
<p>“After the murder of Clerval, I returned to</p>
<p>Switzerland, heart-broken and overcome. I pitied</p>
<p>Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror: I ab-</p>
<p>horred myself. But when I discovered that he, the</p>
<p>author at once of my existence and of its unspeak-</p>
<p>able torments, dared to hope for happiness; that</p>
<p>while he accumulated wretchedness and despair</p>
<p>upon me, he sought his own enjoyment in feelings</p>
<p>and passions from the indulgence of which I was for</p>
<p>ever barred, then impotent envy and bitter indigna-</p>
<p>tion ﬁlled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance.</p>
<p>I recollected my threat, and resolved that it should</p>
<p>be accomplished. I knew that I was preparing for</p>
<p>myself a deadly torture; but I was the slave, not the</p>
<p>master of an impulse, which I detested, yet could</p>
<p>not disobey. Yet when she died! — nay, then I was</p>
<p>not miserable. I had cast off all feeling, subdued</p>
<p>all anguish to riot in the excess of my despair. Evil</p>
<p>thenceforth became my good. Urged thus far, I had</p>
<p>no choice but to adapt my nature to an element</p>
<p>which I had willingly chosen. The completion of my</p>
<p>demoniacal design became an insatiable passion.</p>
<p>And now it is ended; there is my last victim!”</p>
<p>I was at ﬁrst touched by the expressions of his</p>
<p>misery; yet when I called to mind what Frankenstein</p>
<p>had said of his powers of eloquence and persua-</p>
<p>sion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless</p>
<p>form of my friend, indignation was re-kindled within</p>
<p>me. “Wretch!” I said, “it is well that you come here to</p>
<p>whine over the desolation that you have made. You</p>
<p>throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they</p>
<p>are consumed you sit among the ruins, and lament</p>
<p>the fall. Hypocritical ﬁend! if he whom you mourn</p>
<p>still lived, still would he be the object, again would</p>
<p>he become the prey of your accursed vengeance.</p>
<p>It is not pity that you feel; you lament only because</p>
<p>the victim of your malignity is withdrawn from your</p>
<p>power.”</p>
<p>“Oh, it is not thus — not thus,” interrupted the</p>
<p>being; “yet such must be the impression conveyed</p>
<p>to you by what appears to be the purport of my</p>
<p>actions. Yet I seek not a fellow-feeling in my mis-</p>
<p>ery. No sympathy may I ever ﬁnd. When I ﬁrst</p>
<p>sought it, it was the love of virtue, the feelings of</p>
<p>happiness and affection with which my whole be-</p>
<p>ing overﬂowed, that I wished to be participated.</p>
<p>But now, that virtue has become to me a shadow,</p>
<p>and that happiness and affection are turned into</p>
<p>bitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek</p>
<p>for sympathy? I am content to suffer alone, while</p>
<p>my sufferings shall endure: when I die, I am well</p>
<p>satisﬁed that abhorrence and opprobrium should</p>
<p>load my memory. Once my fancy was soothed with</p>
<p>dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once</p>
<p>I falsely hoped to meet with beings, who, pardoning</p>
<p>my outward form, would love me for the excellent</p>
<p>qualities which I was capable of bringing forth. I</p>
<p>was nourished with high thoughts of honour and</p>
<p>devotion. But now vice has degraded me beneath</p>
<p>the meanest animal. No crime, no mischief, no ma-</p>
<p>lignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine.</p>
<p>When I call over the frightful catalogue of my deeds,</p>
<p>I cannot believe that I am he whose thoughts were</p>
<p>once ﬁlled with sublime and transcendant visions</p>
<p>of the beauty and the majesty of goodness. But it</p>
<p>is even so; the fallen angel becomes a malignant</p>
<p>devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man had</p>
<p>friends and associates in his desolation; I am quite</p>
<p>alone.</p>
<p>“You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to</p>
<p>have a knowledge of my crimes and his misfortunes.</p>
<p>But, in the detail which he gave you of them, he</p>
<p>could not sum up the hours and months of misery</p>
<p>which I endured, wasting in impotent passions. For</p>
<p>whilst I destroyed his hopes, I did not satisfy my own</p>
<p>desires. They were for ever ardent and craving;</p>
<p>still I desired love and fellowship, and I was still</p>
<p>spurned. Was there no injustice in this? Am I to</p>
<p>be thought the only criminal, when all human kind</p>
<p>sinned against me? Why do you not hate Felix, who</p>
<p>drove his friend from his door with contumely? Why</p>
<p>do you not execrate the rustic who sought to destroy</p>
<p>the saviour of his child? Nay, these are virtuous</p>
<p>and immaculate beings! I, the miserable and the</p>
<p>abandoned, am an abortion, to be spurned at, and</p>
<p>kicked, and trampled on. Even now my blood boils</p>
<p>at the recollection of this injustice.</p>
<p>“But it is true that I am a wretch. I have mur-</p>
<p>dered the lovely and the helpless; I have strangled</p>
<p>the innocent as they slept, and grasped to death</p>
<p>his throat who never injured me or any other living</p>
<p>thing. I have devoted my creator, the select spec-</p>
<p>imen of all that is worthy of love and admiration</p>
<p>among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to</p>
<p>that irremediable ruin. There he lies, white and cold</p>
<p>in death. You hate me; but your abhorrence cannot</p>
<p>equal that with which I regard myself. I look on the</p>
<p>hands which executed the deed; I think on the heart</p>
<p>in which the imagination of it was conceived, and</p>
<p>long for the moment when they will meet my eyes,</p>
<p>when it will haunt my thoughts, no more.</p>
<p>“Fear not that I shall be the instrument of fu-</p>
<p>ture mischief. My work is nearly complete. Neither</p>
<p>your’s nor any man’s death is needed to consum-</p>
<p>mate the series of my being, and accomplish that</p>
<p>which must be done; but it requires my own. Do</p>
<p>not think that I shall be slow to perform this sacri-</p>
<p>ﬁce. I shall quit your vessel on the ice-raft which</p>
<p>brought me hither, and shall seek the most northern</p>
<p>extremity of the globe; I shall collect my funeral pile,</p>
<p>and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that</p>
<p>its remains may afford no light to any curious and</p>
<p>unhallowed wretch, who would create such another</p>
<p>as I have been. I shall die. I shall no longer feel the</p>
<p>agonies which now consume me, or be the prey of</p>
<p>feelings unsatisﬁed, yet unquenched. He is dead</p>
<p>who called me into being; and when I shall be no</p>
<p>more, the very remembrance of us both will speed-</p>
<p>ily vanish. I shall no longer see the sun or stars,</p>
<p>or feel the winds play on my cheeks. Light, feeling,</p>
<p>and sense, will pass away; and in this condition</p>
<p>must I ﬁnd my happiness. Some years ago, when</p>
<p>the images which this world affords ﬁrst opened</p>
<p>upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of sum-</p>
<p>mer, and heard the rustling of the leaves and the</p>
<p>chirping of the birds, and these were all to me, I</p>
<p>should have wept to die; now it is my only consola-</p>
<p>tion. Polluted by crimes, and torn by the bitterest</p>
<p>remorse, where can I ﬁnd rest but in death?</p>
<p>“Farewell! I leave you, and in you the last of</p>
<p>human kind whom these eyes will ever behold.</p>
<p>Farewell, Frankenstein! If thou wert yet alive, and</p>
<p>yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it</p>
<p>would be better satiated in my life than in my de-</p>
<p>struction. But it was not so; thou didst seek my</p>
<p>extinction, that I might not cause greater wretched-</p>
<p>ness; and if yet, in some mode unknown to me,</p>
<p>thou hast not yet ceased to think and feel, thou</p>
<p>desirest not my life for my own misery. Blasted as</p>
<p>thou wert, my agony was still superior to thine; for</p>
<p>the bitter sting of remorse may not cease to rankle</p>
<p>in my wounds until death shall close them for ever.</p>
<p>“But soon,” he cried, with sad and solemn enthu-</p>
<p>siasm, “I shall die, and what I now feel be no longer</p>
<p>felt. Soon these burning miseries will be extinct. I</p>
<p>shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly, and exult</p>
<p>in the agony of the torturing ﬂames. The light of</p>
<p>that conﬂagration will fade away; my ashes will be</p>
<p>swept into the sea by the winds. My spirit will sleep</p>
<p>in peace; or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus.</p>
<p>Farewell.”</p>
<p>He sprung from the cabin-window, as he said</p>
<p>this, upon the ice-raft which lay close to the vessel.</p>
<p>He was soon borne away by the waves, and lost in</p>
<p>darkness and distance.</p>
<p>THE END.</p>
